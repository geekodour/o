*TIP:*

- I did some internet comparison/study when preparing this selfhosting setup. I always take notes when studying anything, all my notes related to selfhosting [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/posts/20230212140130-selfhosting/][can be found here in my wiki]].
- Check "tags" and "Links to this note" in the wiki page.

* What's the shape?
The homelab is one of my passion projects. It's not even birthed yet and there's so much to do and experiment with. If things go alright, I'll probably have my dream homelab in 1-2 years. I [[https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html][want it]] [[https://tajd.co.uk/2021/12/29/literate-emacs-terraform#fn:2][well]] [[https://howardism.org/Technical/Emacs/literate-devops.html][documented]], well [[https://wiki.kasad.com/books/kasadcom][maintained]], reproducible, high quality and of-course do all the things I want it to do. Why? Vendor independence, privacy, costs, peace of mind, fun. pro: you can fix the problem, con: you have to fix the problem.

** Properties
- Should have solid observability. This is also my playground for things.
- Upto-date and mostly automated
- Good and live documentation and should be easily debug-able
- It's not like I want to selfhost everything, if there are external hosted services which satisfy my needs I would skip selfhosting. I want this to be seamless, controlled and do not want to spend hours on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/comments/gz1mka/moving_all_iot_devices_to_vlan_what_steps_should/ftdw3zh/][debugging any]] issue. Same goes for hardware.
- I am not building enterprise network here, I can have fun so stupid stuff is sort of allowed

*NOTE:*
- I have not built the homelab, this is first draft plan.
- These are not actual boundaries, I am just laying out an abstract layout here for me to build on.
- Things might be not be technically correct(I might be placing things in the wrong places of the stack as-well)
- I have not thought all of this properly but merely dumping ideas here. *this is NOT the topology*

** Goku
:PROPERTIES:
:REMARK: Bastion server, External VPS
:TABLE: 1
:END:
Sort of a [[https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-bastion-host/][bastion host]]. Idea is to have access to all my services from one place. Eg. I should be able to ssh from my phone to this machine and manage things even if I am away from my laptop. It should have the tools installed I need in a dev/sysadmin machine.
- *Location*: VPS
- *Threat Model*: Assume that it can be compromised and reduce attack surface accordingly.
- *Possible stuff here*: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1031chv/simple_way_to_centralize_my_server_logs/][centralized logging]], centralized observability center, orchestrator center, [[https://goteleport.com/][Teleport]] w 2FA
- *Concerns*: The usecase and motive of this component sort of contradicts. I am expecting this to be target but at the same time making this the most powerful and yet SOP in a way? Need to think.

This is my phone. This is more like a remote control for things and I've set some phone specific tasker profiles which are super useful. Eg. Taking picture and Uploading it to my Google Drive via SMS trigger etc.
* Orchestration
We have few options.
| Name       | Remark                                                                   |
| Nomad      | Based [[https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/h7gvn0/nomad_development_sandbox/][on]] [[https://github.com/aldoborrero/hashi-homelab][what]] I [[https://mrkaran.dev/posts/home-server-nomad/][read]] it [[https://www.carrot.blog/posts/2023/01/self-hosting-mastodon-aws-nomad/][seems]] like [[https://datakurre.pandala.org/2020/09/nix-nomad/][this]] would be suitable for my homelab |
| Kubernetes | There are things [[https://github.com/thaum-xyz/ankhmorpork][like k3s]]                                                |
| Promox     | Runs LXC and VMs, Min 3 nodes needed                                     |
What keeps everything together? I have not decided yet but guess it'll be a mix of terraform and [[https://0xc45.com/blog/ansible-defined-homelab/][ansible]].

I think I'll go with Nomad like I mentioned.

* Networking
Goals
- I should be able to access(ssh) certain private devices/services securely from the public internet.
- I should be able to access certain public services securely from the public internet. (eg. fileserver, mediaserver etc)
- Local devices should be able to talk to each other, preferably put local devices into a different VLAN and internet facing stuff into a DMZ.
- Should have a proper way to access geoblocked content
- Security, have not thought about my threat model properly.
Anti-Goals
- Not trying to be anonymous here
- Even though I want to build a mesh network, in this iteration it's not the goal. At most I might be use tailscale or something similar.
** VPN
- *Mesh VPN setup*
  - Goal: Allow my devices to talk to [[https://piyushaggarwal.in/2024/02/05/mesh-vpns-and-self-hosting/][each]] other
  - Something like Tailscale is looking juicy here
- *Road warrior setup (VPN VPS)*
  - Goal: Something that allows me to access my devices at home when I am out.
- *Encrypted Traffic + Hide source IP(geo) setup*
  - Goal: Not anonymity but more of privacy and bypassing censorship. Eg. When using insecure public wifi or anything else that fits.
  - I can selfhost this but with that I cannot keep switching countries etc. So might be good idea to go with something like [[https://mullvad.net/en/][Mullvad VPN]]
- *Tunnels*
  - Goal: Expose public only services quickly, give temporary access to something that I am running locally etc.
** Proxy
*** Forward Proxy
I do not really feel the need of a forward proxy as such at the moment. But I can see one usecase: Censorship bypass. Setting up shadowsocks, vray and cloak along w tor proxy(whatever combination makes sense for the usecase) might be a good idea. Because you don't need them until you need them :)
*** Reverse Proxy
I can use these things to do load-balancing/ssl termination/reverse proxy/protocol demultiplexing/[[https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ytg5kf/high_availability_for_beginners/][HA]]/failover/caching/rate-limiting etc. Here's [[https://github.com/GrrrDog/weird_proxies][a more]] [[https://www.authelia.com/overview/prologue/supported-proxies/][complete list]]. After some comparison, I think i'll be going with either Traefik or Caddy.
** Router
- We have the options of OpenWRT and OPNSense here. We can mix and match, will think of exact topology later.
- Point web services logs to fail2ban and let it handle rate-limiting etc.
- For extra points can check Crowdsec
** DNS
This is one bad boi. I probably just want to run local resolver. Maybe an authoritative server replicated to secondaries later. But for now, I plan PiHole/Blocky+Unbound.
- Once we have a reverse-proxy setup, you can have your local DNS server point to your reverse proxy for whatever domain. eg. =*.home=. Also see [[https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/homenet-domain-name.html][what domain name to use for your home network? home.arpa]]
- Some people recommend doing split-horizon DNS along with reverse-proxy if running multiple services, I don't see a point rn but maybe I'll later.
** Local Network
*** VLANs and Subnets
- *Reason:* It's nice to separate things with vlans and firewall rules + IoT devices are known to be [[https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/rt7k6y/how_does_an_entire_network_get_compromised_after/][insecure]]. (Sort of an overkill but who cares)
- Subnets
  - VLAN 1 for home devices LAN
  - VLAN 2 for trusted IoT which cannot run VPN client, access to the Internet allowed
  - VLAN 3 for isolated (untrusted) IoT devices
  - VLAN 4 for DMZ for publicly hosted services etc
- VPN runs on VLAN1
- What comes and goes out of these VLANS to be configured via firewalls
- [ ] Check if we'll need a managed switch or OpenWRT [[https://www.reddit.com/r/openwrt/comments/vaqhph/vlans_without_a_builtin_switch/][will cut it]]
*** DMZ
- Reason: Because I plan to host public facing services it makes sense to have a DMZ.
- Objective is to provide firewall capabilities between hosts in the DMZ and hosts on the internal network.
** Monitoring the network
I haven't explored this properly, so just link dumping.

* Backup Plan
#+attr_html: :class book-hint danger small-text
#+begin_quote
*NOTE* ⚠

- I have not started backing up anything at the moment, there are just scattered copies etc.
- This will be an incremental process, but will start soon. (18th Feb'23)
- In some cases I *need to do some prior work*, eg. my video files are scrattered all over the internet and different drives. I have to put them together into one place before I even think of backing them up.
#+end_quote
After some reading and going through [[https://github.com/restic/others][various backup]] solutions, I decided that the primary tool to make my backups will be [[https://restic.net/][restic]]. I initially [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BorgBackup/comments/v3bwfg/why_should_i_switch_from_restic_to_borg/][considered]] [[https://www.rsync.net/products/borg.html][borg with rysnc.net]], but using restic lets me use [[https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html][cheaper storage]] alternatives and at the time of this writing I am trying to cut costs. I haven't really looked into [[https://www.tarsnap.com/design.html][tarsnap]] but I wanted to.

- The main strategy I am going to follow is the [[https://github.com/geerlingguy/my-backup-plan][3-2-1 strategy]]. (3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite) + *restore tested*.
- I am not backing up emails, DMs etc as I consider them ephemeral and I try to set disappear timer in most of them.
