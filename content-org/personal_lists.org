* Wrong Deals
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: wrong_deals
:END:
- 1996: I did not ask to be born. I exist without my consent.
- 2007: For some reason, I trusted bharat da at rajdhani internet cafe who told me to give up programming and study networking because programming got no jobs. I would probably be a totally different person today if I didn't listen to him. But I guess, it's cool. I had fun along the way. But yeah, this was definitely a wrong deal.
- 2015: Joining GIMT(my engineering college) was the worst fucking decision of my entire life. I finally ended up dropping out of college in the final year because I had too many backlogs and I could not take the daily bullshit the college was throwing at me. Ask me to bitch about my college if you meet me IRL ever( I need to be 2 beer down ).

* Don't like it
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: dontlikeit

- I think people are suffering, maybe things are not so bad. Think I need to get some reality check around this. There are books around this that I need to read too.
- I think there are more stupid people than smart people. I am not sure about this because it's contexual but seems like it.

Writing prompts.
** What if dogs could talk?
This would be very nice because this will mean that choco(my dog) would start speaking and understanding. Then she'll actually undertstand that I am calling her a monkey. Also she'll know that I love her and not hate her.
** What if humans could fly?
World hunger solved man. Mlon Eusk should just work on building wings for humans instead of trying to buy a bird house.

* Communities
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: communities
:END:
This involves both offline and online community.

** I was part of
*** Offline
- School and Tuition folks
- Gauhati Artists' Guild
- Bamunimaidan Drama School
- Oil India badminton gang
- Okonir naamghar (Khol classes)
- Developers from Guwahati
- Artists/Photographers/Videographers from Guwahati
- Very small set of startup founders from Guwahati (idk man most of them are like idk doing shit that i don't really like but good for them)
- College kids (did not like my time here at all)
- Clarisights people
*** Online
- Few cool but niche twitter people from Bangalore and Delhi i guess
- Indian hackathon(esp devfolio folks) and the opensource community
- Prometheus people
** I want to be part of
These are communities/micro communities that I wish to explore and be a part of.
*** Indie Developers
These are people who call themselves builders. They build businesses, some build for fun. The community primarily revolves around how we can monzonite our side projects and such. Some examples that I can recall, [[https://getmakerlog.com/][Makerlog]], [[https://barnacl.es/][Barnacles,]] [[https://www.indiehackers.com/][Indie Hackers]]
*** Gamers
I didn't play a proper game since 2010. Been almost 12 years now. I loved to play games. I now have a desktop which can run most latest games, think I'll start gaming again and join the gaming people I know. They're very nice people.
*** Rationality folks
Some places I think which can be good starting points: [[https://www.gwern.net/][Gwern]], [[https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/][Slate Star Codex]], [[https://www.lesswrong.com/about][LessWrong]], [[https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/][EA Forum]]
*** Twitter
I have been using twitter for many years, but never been a power user. Think as I am already using it, better use it properly and make more nice friends. Some resources which might help me up my game: [[https://tasshin.com/blog/a-guide-to-twitter/][A Guide to Twitter]] , [[https://github.com/igorbrigadir/twitter-advanced-search][Advanced Search for Twitter]]
*** Reddit
If I had to list which websites changed my life in big ways, it has to be Google and Reddit. To me, Reddit is like the ISS of the internet. I always leave the site impressed, depressed or amused. At-least it makes me feel real things. I've been a lurker though, want to be more active there eventually.
*** StackExchange
Stack Exchange is a network of question-and-answer websites on topics in diverse fields, each site covering a specific topic. Developers usually hang around stackoverflow but the other communities are also pretty awesome in my experience. Here are a few that I might just want to hang around: [[https://serverfault.com/][Server Fault]], [[https://dba.stackexchange.com/][Database Administrators SE]], [[https://crypto.stackexchange.com/][Cryptography SE]], [[https://security.stackexchange.com/][Information Security SE]], [[https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/][Network Engineering SE]], [[https://electronics.stackexchange.com/][Electrical Engineering SE]], [[https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/][Raspberry Pi SE]], [[https://cs.stackexchange.com/][Computer Science SE]], [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/][Unix & Linux SE]], [[https://math.stackexchange.com/][Mathematics SE]], [[https://physics.stackexchange.com/][Physics SE]], [[https://stats.stackexchange.com/][Cross Validated]]
*** Guwahati Art and Design community
Think these bunch are onto something. Pretty cool stuff.

* Apologies
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: apologies
:END:
- I apologize for all the memes I have stolen and also for all the memes I am going to steal in the future.
- I apologize to all the people I have ghosted, in my defense I have been ghosted 3x so this is reactionary man. üò¢
- I sometimes steal writing snippets and do not give credit. I mean idk. Eg things like I probably stole this very line from somewhere, how am I supposed to give credit to this line. Whole document will be full of footnotes otherwise.
- I am very werid in person, sometimes I'll speak non-stop, sometimes I'll just sit like a ghost. If I ever creeped you out just by existing, I am sorry about it.
* Quotes
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: quotes
:END:
Thoughts that my came across on the internet, most of them are clich√© and cringe, some are paraphrased, some are directly stolen, some are original(lol) probably.
** Education and Research
  - As a PhD student, your post reads like a beautiful research paper. Motivation, prior work, contributions, technical details, example use cases, self-references, future work, even a system design chart. You've certainly sold me on the extension, great work!
  - In Theory, Theory and Practice are the same. In Practice they're not.
  - You may not be the smartest person in your field, but you should know the most about it.
  - there is very little that you cannot learn, just things you haven‚Äôt learned yet.
  - Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.
  - And we must study through reading, listening, discussing, observing, and thinking. We must not neglect any one of those ways of studying. The trouble with most of us is that we fall down on the latter /thinking/ because it's hard work for people to think. All of the problems of the world could be settled easily if men were only willing to think.  - Thomas J Watson
  - One of the dirtiest tricks the Indian education system plays on students is to make students believe that they are not capable of doing something so as to filter out students ultimately achieving nothing
  - Spending a few days researching the topic always completely changes how I am going to solve it.
  - Every time we do sit down to learn something, we have to make a decision whether to widen our breadth of knowledge, or to dig deeper into something we're already familiar with. Then we have to decide which thing within those two broad categories we're going to tackle.
  - Breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately needed.
  - We discovered that education is not something which the teacher does, but that it is a natural process which develops spontaneously in the human being
  - A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.
  - It was more important to inspire the students so that they wanted to learn, than to actually teach them the material
  - What I cannot create, I do not understand. ‚Äì Richard Feynman
** Programming
  - why would u write code without documenting it, write for humans man. computer toh 1 and 0 bhi samajh lega.
  - ActivityPub isn't the future. Useful things that are built, brought to market, and meet user needs that may happen to use ActivityPub under the hood are the future. Knowing what is useful for whom and how to bring it to market in a sustainable manner for the people it's intended for is a super critical element. One that's often overlooked. Specs are like plumbing pipes. People care about sinks, showers, and stuff like that. The pipe fittings, materials, and sizes enable a lot. But, it's not what the end users tend to care about.
  - Simple things should be simple it's ok if complicated things are complicated.
  - If you try 'cat /boot/vmlinuz > /dev/dsp' (on a properly configured system) you should hear some sound on the speaker. That's the sound of your kernel!
  - Main challenge in real-world software engineering is not writing code but changing code once it is written and deployed.
  - I read about bootfs at a book from our libraries university from 2019. I contacted the lector of it and he contacted the authors and it turned out, that they had their information from the internet, including stackoverflow. Unfortunately I had to rethink my trust in books. - some SO post
  - "When to use iterative development? You should use iterative development only on projects that you want to succeed." - MF
  - We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code. -David Clark 1992
  - A little duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
  - Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
  - The more I research, read, talk to folks, and think about programming, the more I‚Äôm convinced that there are no rules. There are only guidelines.
  - "Train Basic every day!"‚Äîreads a poster (bottom center) in a Russian school (c. 1985‚Äì1986).
  - adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
  - "The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming."
  - The truth is that programming isn't a passion or a talent, it is just a bunch of skills that can be learned. Programming isn't even one thing, though he had been talking about it as if it were; it requires all sorts of skills and coding is just a small part of that. Things like design, communication, writing, and debugging are needed. Also, "we need to have at least one person who understands Unicode", he said to laughter.
  - =grep= is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the **ed** editor: g/re/p meaning "Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines"
  - The most important advice I can share with you, as you're starting out, is that a career is a long road, with many twists and turns along the way. The best way I know of to excel in software is to keep a growth mindset. The more you can learn and improve, the more career options you'll have.
  - No website is as good as a good book. And no good book is as good as a disassembly output.
  - A three-line proof of a subtle theorem is the distillation of years of activity. Reading mathematics involves a return to the thinking that went into the writing
  - Knowledge Debt, Being a programmer is about being in a continuous state of learning. Letting knowledge debt accumulate can slowly bring your career and productivity to a halt. If you have a knowledge debt in an area that is essential to your work, you will find that it takes more time and effort to write new features and much, much more time and effort to fixing bugs. The longer you take in returning the debt, the more ‚Äútime interest‚Äù it will cost you.
  - Matching string sequences is one of the most common problems you‚Äôll face as a programmer.
  - Reminder that it takes just as much effort (time, money, staff, etc.) to build the wrong thing as it does the right thing. Problem discovery is under appreciated as a practice in software engineering, especially when compared to problem solving.
  - The device(mouse) was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.
  - Condition your brain to think in the world of data structures.
  - As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise‚ÄîBy what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time?
  - John Carmak on DRY on twitter
    - Everyone knows that when you have similar code repeated several times that you should consolidate into a loop or function, but changing discrete variables into arrays and adding loops can have a small readability cost, so sometimes it can feel like a debatable choice for something small just repeated two or three times.
    - Usually, optimizing for readability is positive, but a requirement to keep two separate things aligned through future changes is an ‚Äúinvisible constraint‚Äù that is quite likely to cause problems eventually.
    - Many years ago, I would casually copy-paste-paste-paste-modify 4D vector statements, but now I almost never even do two related statements like that.
    - The hazard is when you combine two things that are close, but not exactly the same, and the strain induces complexity.
    - "Don't Repeat Yourself" versus "Repeat Once or Twice"
    - But when things aren‚Äôt exactly the same, do it three times before trying to infer an abstraction.
** Management
- Till the time we don‚Äôt create strong communities, we will always feel alone. It is just mind tricking us in believing that ‚ÄòI‚Äô is the most powerful entity in our best/worst moments. To create strong communities, we must accept that humans comes in different shades/color/psyche
- anti productivity can be a new productivity, anti-brand can be new form of brand
- Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration. I try to learn certain areas of computer science exhaustively; then I try to digest that knowledge into a form that is accessible to people who don't have time for such study. - Donald Knuth
- While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done, it was done.
- This thing we call ‚Äúmoney‚Äù is just a (slow, lossy & unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor & necessitate UBI. - elon
- The world might criticize your ideas. Let that feedback sharpen your insights. You need to be devoid of emotions when it comes to seeking knowledge. The moment you judge yourself for your curiosity, for your desire to connect the dots, you will not grow.
- Find faults to fix, not to blame.
- Ask to be involved early or ask for clarity, we can only pick one.
- How Apple makes even Microsoft seem well-behaved and conformant.
- As soon as you give people a metric they're judged by, they optimize for that metric rather than do quality work.
- Cashflow is like oxygen, cut it off and firm falls apart.
- √òrsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the **thought experiment**.
- absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
- Euler went blind and said ‚ÄúNow there will be fewer distractions‚Äù.
** Science
  - We thought the Internet was going to be a global library but then it turned out to be a global bookstore instead. Nice coffee tho.
  - The term "galvanometer," in common use by 1836, was derived from the surname of Italian electricity researcher Luigi Galvani, who in 1791 discovered that electric current would make a dead frog's leg jerk.
** Random
- hey baby unclench ur jaw blink a few times drink some water
- Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?
- Not really facts‚Ä¶ more like loosely postulated theories presented with overconfidence.
- Yggdrasil is an immense mythical tree that plays a central role in Norse cosmology, where it connects the Nine Worlds.
- With passive learning (like passively reading), you get the most limited form of understanding/knowing. It is ephemeral, and you are not able to reconstruct that on your own. The second level is "knowing by first hand experience". At this level, you are able to understand/witness and if necessary rediscover the knowledge on your own. Finally, the third level is "knowing by heart". At this level, you internalized the knowledge so that it becomes part of your nature. You grok it. - Murat
** Life
- The main idea is to understand how your brain works, so you can understand its strengths and weaknesses, using its strengths and compensating for its weaknesses.
- Lock yourself in a room making 5 beats a day for 3 summers - ye
- You can take a break when you're dead ;-;
- Introversion is the state of primarily obtaining gratification from one's own mental life
- I haven't failed, i just postponed by success - Rajnikanth
- People who change their minds have a tendency of being right a lot.
- Nothing is really ours until we share it. (C. S. Lewis)
- Don't waste a second looking back at your expectations. Face forward, and face it with a smug little grin.
- Humans don't have direct access to reality, we view reality [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWiM-LuRe6w][via our cultures]]. Social media as of 2023 by curation of content has created an illusion that some people confuse with reality.
- I speak only of myself since I do not wish to convince, I have no right to drag others into my river, I oblige no one to follow me and everybody practices his art in his own way. - Dada Manifesto 1918
- lack of regret is hell of a drug
- You will rarely get more than what you're willing to ask for. By not risking a rejection, you reject yourself before anyone else can.
- We live what? 75-85 years? I don't want to retire at 60 only to go to the hospital for the last 10-15 years of my life, some redditor
- The most important thing is the ability to survive until you get lucky
- "If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be." - Yogi Berra
- Most people forget that the goal isn‚Äôt money. The goal is to spend days as you wish.
- Consistency is the exponent.
- The odds increase, the harder you try.
- The greatest enemy of a good plan, is the dream of a perfect plan
- If you don't ask for anything, don't be surprised when you get nothing
- There are so many interesting topics I want to learn, but "I don't have time". The sad reality is: we do have time. We just waste so much of it. Sometimes I look at my screen time and see the hours I could've spent productively. But time management is harder than it sounds.
- "So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You'd better rearrange your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can't rearrange the universe."
- Everybody wants to win, but the winners are the rare ones who obsessively practice their craft.
- don't do your best, do whatever it takes.
- The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.
- Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send
- Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god.
- Do not confuse motion and progress (man riding a toy horse)
- Attaching your happiness or sadness to someone is the quickest way to lose
- Manage your time like a CEO of multi billion dollar company. Seriously, don't waste your time. TV shows, movies, songs, endless bakchodi with friends is easy to do but does give you anything in return.
- Be soft spoken and DO NOT react to anything
- Don‚Äôt compare your day-to-day activities with everybody‚Äôs highlight reel
- What they say is required is not really what is required.
- The whole world is not looking at you.
- Keep your word. Do what you say you will do.

- Joy, Happiness and Satisfaction
  - Joy is jumping into puddle
  - Happiness is seeing your son jump in a puddle
  - Satisfaction is knowing that you jumped into a puddle
- Somebody once described balance to me as three buckets filled with water. One for career, a second for physical health, and a third for social and family life. At any point, one bucket might be running low. But as long as the overall water level is high enough, things should be fine. Importantly: the water represents your level of satisfaction, not the hours you spend.
- 2 things the rock does to manage his psychology:
  - remember what it was like when he  started with nothing
  - ask himself ‚Äúhow bad of a motherfucker do you think you are‚Äù
** Creating
- My favorite phase of any project is the one where nobody knows what to do and everything seems impossible.
- In writing, the fastest way to build credibility is to state the other side‚Äôs argument better than they can
- We can fix it. We have the technology. OK. We need to create the technology. Alright. The policy guys are mucking with the technology. Relax. WE'RE ON IT. Dan Kaminsky's Bio.

- Speed is important when creating stuff.
  - 2 things
    - More [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36312295][smaller]] iterations

  - More speed = More shit gets done per unit time
  - Time is asset, if you know you can do things fast, cost(time) of doing something in your mind is low, so you'd want to do it. It helps with getting the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy][activation energy]].

- A developed country is one where the rich take the public transport, not one where poor people have cars
** Startup
- Being an entrepreneur is the arts and science of accomplishing more with less money, less time, less staff etc.

- If you don‚Äôt have a enough capital to launch your business  the way you plan, change your plan.
- Starting a business is truly a marathon, not a sprint.
- It takes a village to create something great, you need others and make sure they share your values.
- If there is no competition, there is no market.
- Money only accelerates success or failure - it will not turn something poor into something great by itself.
- Consistently create value for nothing in return for your target personas (eg content marketing, freebies) and it will pay dividends exponentially in the long-run.
- Do the right thing instead of compromise.
- Maintain a goal beyond just rewards for yourself.
** Making money
All this might be cringe but sometimes motivation is useful.
- *Be an unrelenting machine:* Commit to your goals and do not waver from them a one bit regardless of what else is there. If your goals is to become a millionaire, you need to be an unrelenting machine that does not let emotions make you give up / stop. You either get it done with 100% commitment or you don't. Be a machine.
- *Market opportunity:* A million dollars isn't a lot but it can be a lot if the market opportunity is not large enough. Bill Gates and Steve Jobs put together cannot become too wealthy without changing the business if the TAM is $10bn.
- *Leverage:* Leverage skills you know, Leverage information that others undervalue
- *Distribution channels:* Get as many distribution channels as possible, each one by itself may not be large, but if you have many it starts to add up. It also diversifies your risk.
- *Go w gut:* Go with what your gut says, regardless of how it might look to the rest of the world. Fame is fleeting in the traditional sense. Become famous with your customers. They're the ones that truly matter. What they think matters and they will ultimately put their money where their mouth is.
- *Be a master of information:* It gives you an edge.
- *Make waves, don't ride them:* Youtube introduced (flash+one click upload+share), other people rode the wave.
- *Be so good they can't ignore you:* Applies to both self and product.
- *Look for the accessory ecosystem:* If there's a huge new product/shift, there's usually money to be made in the accessory ecosystem.
- *Productize a service:* If you can make what might normally be considered a service into a scaleable, repeatable, and efficient process that makes it seem like a product you can make a good amount of money.
** Relationships
- Scar tissues ([[https://gist.github.com/gtallen1187/27a585fcf36d6e657db2][talk given by John Ousterhout about sustaining relationships]])
 - A single catastrophic event around the the end of the relationship, but that‚Äôs typically a symptom rather than a cause.
 - What typically happens is it accumulates in the little things that just build up over time, and I call those scar tissues.
 - when you have a wound that doesn't heal quite properly and you get this other tissue that just sort of fills the gap, which is called scar tissue, and that tissue is not as strong as the original tissue that was there. So, scar tissue is weak
 - You know if you ever hear the phrase "You always X": scar tissue.
 - So, when there's an issue, you somehow have to resolve it where there is zero lingering animosity.
 - Some people are just too nice, and they wreck the relationships. They think, ‚ÄúOh, it's not a big deal, it's just one little thing, not worth having a big argument about it. I'll just give in.‚Äù Well, that seems generous, but it's a really bad idea. You have to ask yourself, "Are you really, completely, 100% over this? You're giving in? No animosity? You're not secretly hoping that maybe they'll do something for you in return or a little behavior change here or there?"
 - The trick is, again, you just have to avoid the creation of scar tissue. Not easy, but it's the only solution.

  - ADHD+maturity = super power, ADHD+excuses = nightmare

  - No porn for 15 years. Quitting porn took 3 years, cig 1 year

  - Write. Your. Shit. Down. Write before you do something, it's okay if I deviate. check later why deviated. Support the brain. Find patterns.
  - adhd like minds have tremendous rate of fire. but they take time to spin up. they jam easily. Key is to understanding how it is different, what are the contexts in which it excels, what are the contexts in which it doesn't, how to seek help/assistance. Getting lost is a feature not a bug, the only real problem is getting jammed.
    - When you see what a complicated piece of machinery this is, and how ‚Äúheavy duty‚Äù it is, it becomes clear how easily it could jam.
  - adhd is smarter than you, more stubborn than you, and WILL outmaneuver you. So don't try to bully your mind into things, it's pointless. It will outlast your executive function. ADHD can remain ‚Äúirrational‚Äù longer than your executive function can stay solvent. ADHD brain does not give a fuck about negative reinforcement.
    - declare a trust bankruptcy. recognise that the approach so far has not worked. no shame. see the best in yourself. build trust.
  - Saying what you‚Äôre going to do, then doing it. Build your confidence back. Build tiny wins. No longer feel like a bullshitter. Do little things that you can celebrate. Momentum is worth it. Small dominos can knock over larger dominos.
  - so good they can‚Äôt ignore you : so prolific you don‚Äôt recognise yourself
  - On processes to manage: The only thing that really matters to me is a sense of flow and throughput through the entire pipeline.
  - It‚Äôs probably wise to seek a role that relies on your strengths
  - cowardice disguises itself as confusion. the problem isn't that your mind goes fast. the problem is that you have your feet on both the gas and the brakes.

** Jargons
This is a growing list of words that I came across and I thought to myself, I'll probably forget about this but it's nice, better keep a note somewhere. This list is domain agnostic.

* Thankful

:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: thankful
:END:
I do not know how to be grateful. But I try. This page is to dedicated my thanks to all the people and things I am thankful for. This list is obviously not exhaustive. I think there are tools with which you can generate a thankyou page depending on your dependencies etc. but I rather just keep it personal so yeah, this will be very incomplete but like cannot thank people enough, that's what.

- I am thankful to whoever in Nepal came up with the recipe of momo. It made living worthwhile for me.
- I am thankful to my friends for taking all of my shit. I don't know what I would do without them honestly.

These are dumps from my phone notes, some of these came up during conversations, self talk, reading something online etc. This is absolute horseshit btw, I am keeping these for historical reasons and now that i had a look at these, i cringed by a lot and also moved by head left and right in disagreement with myself. These are historical, newer thoughts go into org-journal and it's not public for private reasons.

** Probably selftalk
- Learning something strange requires reassembling of our brain. I like it. I want to do that often.
- It's this process of getting out of this mess that i'll appreciate and not the life i'll live after.
- you want to take the lower bed and a higher shelf on the wardrobe when taking a hostel while traveling.
- i tweet when i feel things. it's a good day when i am tweeting often ig.
- comfort is a cage, do hard things.
- I am and & will not stop. - idk what i mean
- you study all this to become someone you do not want to become just so that you can make some money. once you make dem monie, you're allowed to do what you want. people can't take creative risks here.
- I just want to be a programmer who is comfortable calling himself a programmer
- on inventing: There's a lot of knowledge in other people's head, you can come up with your own knowledge. Lot of knowledge is out there floating in other people's head they did never pay enough attention to that floating thought. Sometimes someone pays extra attention to the thought and tries to formalize it and then that person becomes an inventor, or like the coiner of the term or something
- You know you're working on the edge when you don't have a book for what you're reading. You need to read academic papers etc.
- When trying to learn something it's good to see what space it fits in, see what alternatives it has; what set of problems is it solving. googling alternatives; another nice trick is to look at the category section in wikipedia to see what category of things it falls into even though it's not always 100% accurate.
- I don't want to build companies, I want to build standards, but currently I don't have the skills.
- Time has the ability to make things less valuable, what do we need to make things resistant against it?
- Because the hardware of our brain is not good enough, we need to develop algorithms that suit our mind to understand the world. Some people understand things easily because they have better brains, we can do similar stuff but we need algorithms that fit with our brain and only we can do that to ourselves.
- I am 23, I sometimes wish I was this curious when I was 13. It's okay, you can just reset. You are better equipped now, maybe you can do the things 13yo Hrishi could do twice as fast. You just need to start. You'll age anyway.
- took me a lot of balls to admit that i know nothing about maths at 23 and start doing 6th grade math. - same at 25 lol
- When we try to make a language good the popularity usually lies on the things that were built and then programming language like Erlang by design is very good and stuff but it can be popular because of the things that were built with it similarly if we want to make SMS popular so we have to build more beautiful things with SMS so if you write great books get poetry so the applications of that language should be popular so then eventually the language would become popular
- I think programming is a creative endeavour and I like to put creative people into two buckets, performers and practitioners but usually in my observation people are of the mixed kind.
  - Performers: When practicing these people train their mind and body to perfect components of their art and when performing they let whatever they learned flow through their mind and body and be present in the moment.
  - Practitioners: These people are sort of always working and do not have a stage to perform. They know their art and keep on improving their art as they work their art. Doctors or programmers might seem to fit in as practitioners but they are also performers when it comes to taking the right decision at the right time, coming up with a bright new idea etc. I want to be both but currently none at all. I can‚Äôt code properly and i take stupid decisions, all my decisions are simply intuitions.
- Gaming ping and relation to future: We can simulate future by sending information slower to some user. Future is just unavailability of information in the present. Information here is not just  the knowledge but the happening. Eg. If you have faster connection, you have access to the future.
- If you're not sure whether what you're doing is ethical or not, it's better to not do it. imo.
- does the definition of edge computing include our brains?
- I am deeply troubled. I am stuck in 17yo me when i am 24. I still want the same things, I still have the same dreams. It's not good. I don't like who I am. I have to come out of my body look at myself change myself.
- Using curiosity to learn, see what's happening in the real world in every subject and then reverse engineer from that.
- Me apna privilege bech dega bhenchod. How to sell your privilege.
- The input bandwidth is good, we can take input. But output has to be in some expressive way, talk, draw, act, write etc.
- So form tomorrow and till the day i die, i'll play my cards right no matter what. It's a game and i am here to win and help win.
- I would like to share five stupid realizations (about sorting life):
  - We are on our own journey and comparing with anyone is a complete waste of time. We need to define what sorting our life really meant to us and it's completely okay if that makes zero sense to other people.
  - Understanding the role of luck and how it compliments hard work.
  - Understanding momentum. We need to conserve momentum at all costs. fewer cold starts makes our lives easier. Also easier said than done. How your yoga streak broke.
  - No matter what we do, we should be having fun.
  - talk to stella (very important)
- I am 24, I should already have started on my mission. It's not late but will be late if i start 2-3 years later. It's time.
- If you can't use that knowledge, bro what is the use of that knowledge
- a museum, a library and a education research lab
- It haunts me everyday that i cannot be a computer scientist. It'll merely be a developer no matter how much I try.
- It's nature of life that people will dislike you for no reason. People will tend to express some affection towards you and suddenly they will be completely opposite. There might be no reason for such actions. It's the rules of the games. It's a game you play even if you know you will loose.
- Having emotions is a luxury that I can't afford right now
- Become very true to yourself, write who you think you are, that you're a dumb person with this and this disability, you don't know this and these things you want to do this and this. Basically, write the truth about who i really am. And what is my perspective on life and how i want to live it.
- I like science and history because they help me answer my questions. I want to love and study more maths because It has so many more interesting answers.
- getting back in shape is hard (when trying to re-learn code after not writing code for about a year)
- Humans think very hard to understand their world and by understanding it they are able to represent their views in different forms such as maths. which helps in development of new worlds. Eg. calculus came from observing the world and from someone's mind. then calculus was used to create new things which birthed a new world. It's crazy. - Again, no idea what I am talking about.
- You can only thrive if the environment around you thrives. Applies at personal level too. You need to have control over you aswell as your environment. If the environment around you is instable, you won't be able to be in a stable state for long.
- We humans and like any other animals don't actually understand language. We just get better at identifying sounds. We(animals) communicate with our senses, seeing, tasting, hearing/speaking etc. The fact that animals can communicate with humans without sharing or learning a special language that both of us know points to something else. Plants on the other hand (if they can't hear) they communicate using light, they sense the sunlight. Sunlight becomes a way to indicate them something. (or no?)
- Sometimes i feel physical pain on things that happen in my dream , if someone kicks me in my dream. I mean i don't feel any pain after i wakeup but i am in pain in my dream so a lot of the physical things that humans experience are also mental. (simulation?)
- human-computer interface ‚Üí dream computer interface.
- Even if some human understands a language, he might not understand what's being communicated. Even after having a rational mind, he/she is not able to understand what's being communicated despite being able to understand the language. (Me reading a book on quantum computing). - Obvious but I don't know why i felt the need to put this down.
- History is a data structure that you can use inside you mind to store information about the world. It's a index. The chaos of information becomes better organized if you learn history.
- Wrong mentoring worse than no mentoring
- Of all things one should be able to create happiness for themselves.
- My first job made me hate my entire profession (no hate towards my employer, i was fucked up)
- I am loosing hope in myself. I think this is the very moment i am getting myself into depression or whatever. But i am going to fight it and remember why i am doing all this for. - dec28‚Äô21
- Work ethic means you can get up to 1 from 0 if it happens, keeping notes means that you can get to 1 from 0 even quicker.
- froken bamilies suck so mucking fuch
- If you can ignore the opinion of other people and let them live in peace with their opinions, you can do the same to the opinions that involve you. When you can ignore other people's opinion about you then you truly reach the idgaf attitude which is essential for you to become dangerous.
- As humans, we are manually building our software for our brain rather than using a package manager
- To be able to draw and color whatever came to my dream
- One can spend a lot of time misusing the building blocks if one doesn‚Äôt understand them properly.
- Setting myself in foot of the 15y/o me as a 23 y/o guy. reap the benefits of maturity, judgment with curiosity.
- Sometimes we have to go away from our goal to reach our goal?
- The goal is to find the goal
- Learning from the past was helpful for me because I was good at few things back then which i am not good at now. so when you're good at something make notes so that you can learn from yourself later on in life.
- Mindset
  - Rather than having a recipe, have a mindset.
  - Mindset is a enabler or blocker to learning something.
  - Just givinG inspiration about why you should learn something does not form the mindset needed.
- there's a lot of info out there, but how much of it is relevant?
- I've something to prove, that kids from small villages can do a lot if they are taught the right way. Not giving them the right education and opportunity is discrimination. Internet scales by design, we just have to teach them how to use the internet and possibilities are endless.
- You don't need such strong note taking measures if you don't jump around a lot. But if you do, like me jump around so many areas at the same time. Notetaking becomes v.essential. Eg. if you just work on database you still need notes but since most of the time things will be the same the environment you work with will be your note but for someone who wants the same but also wants to hop into other ideas, need to take notes which is slow and tedious but works imo. - I absolutely have no fucking clue what i am talking about here.
- At every point in time, I make a choice. It's all about making the correct choice. We need to speed up this choice step at the same time make it more accurate. So that we can make all the choices the best and move fast. What will be the correct choice? Future has the answer, look deep into the future.
  - Contradictory, "Life isn't about getting forecasts "right"; it is about navigating the environment and controlling it." i.e if you cannot control a complex environment (x), then control your exposure to it [f(x)].
** Probably conversations with others
- The whole future lies in uncertainity, live immediately
- find something that is enjoyable to you and valuable to others
- The magic isn't in the book, it's in the reading.
- the part of life we really live is small, all the rest of it is not life, but merely time
- We think our opinions are formed through thought and marshaling of facts and evidence. But in reality, most are formed emotionally and then covered over with a thin veneer of "facts" and "evidence."
- "A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
- When two people fall in love, their rational thinking decrease and they become stupid but it feels good
- once you realize that in any given context, you've got a finite amount of influence you can exert on your surroundings. Picture a sports coach who's been yelling at his team for so long, the message falls on deaf ears. Leverage other voices (if the advice is good).
- Your values and your emotions is your political opinion.
- you need to be thinking relative to a problem, you need to have a constraint which you can optimize for, and this tells you what it means to have a right or wrong answer to a question." ‚Äî Situating LessWrong in contemporary philosophy: An interview with Jon Livengood
- i love the smell of coredumps in the morning
- the score takes care of itself if everyone in the organization does their work precisely and accurately and is done consistently. This was jeff Bezos's way of measuring inputs.
- Behaviors that are rewarded in the zoo are suicidal in the jungle.
- Just like food should be the last thing to cut off because of cost. You might not go watch that avengers movie than to have subpar food. Similarly, the education budget is the last thing to do the cut off in, for the funding body.
- life mast nahi, thik chal rahi hai
- A lot of this is about figuring about what works for you. I think a lot of people forget in the pursuit of productivity that what you're really trying to do with a lot of these tools is offload the work that your brain has to do. But then if that process itself requires so much brain work to use and organize and migrate and so on, your brain is being made to do the exact opposite thing you were supposed to help solve in the first place.
- The reason silicon valley was sillicon valley because hardware people and software people were complimenting each other to improve the ecosystem.
- science is the negotiation between our noisy representation and what's actually out there
- A penny saved is a penny earned.
- Flatmate type family bur
- I didn't read books for quite a long time because I thought books will change how I think because I was not ready to think for myself, this helped me form my own view about the world before I started believing on random stuff. i am way too much still the kid who coasted through school on raw intelligence to do things using routine and habit, and i have tried (and failed)
- just sit and think of something emotionally uncharged, basic things. Keep doing it. You can see your thoughts. This sort of proves that you're not your thoughts but in high pressure situation we feel trapped by it and it feels like we are our thoughts. practice stopping thinking about a thought in the middle - Jonathan Blow in some yt video
- It's not that just our brain can be trained our hands can be trained to so kind of non-living things like hands which seem unintelligent things can also be trained for example my right hand can do things but my left hand cannot and if I train my left hand to do it it will be able to do it but at times this actions do not involve the brain my hand just can do direction without having any intelligence in it so work can be a byproduct of training and it can persist
- Training conflict affected youth to become technology leaders
- If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it
- Unless you pick your battles consciously, battles will pick you. And pretty soon, you‚Äôd find yourself fuming about why you‚Äôre not winning.
- Why make the same mistakes others have made and written about?
- ultimate hack that you can learn things by reading
- people contain multitudes
- worst day of fishing better than best day at work
- Theory: Organized body of knowledge with predictive powers
- One unfortunate thing about writing is that you don‚Äôt know whether it has become clearer by the virtue of the writing itself or by having read the thing a hundred times during the edit
