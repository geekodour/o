- I think I spent half of my year last year fighting with emacs, had me learn little bit of elisp and I am not sure if it was worth it, but if there's one thing I cannot live without, it has to be =org-mode=. helluvadrug.
- For documentation lookup inside emacs, =eldoc= (using =elglot=), =M-x man=, =dev-docs= custom bindings for =eww=.
- When I quickly need to check the contents of a repo, I use [[https://github1s.com/][GitHub1s]], pretty neat stuff. I use Replit for quick prototypes etc, pretty neat but need to get back offline as soon as I need to do anything that involves more than 2 files(when writing from scratch).

- For virtual environments, I use =LXD= system containers with a custom cloud-init script. It's pretty neat. Thanks to the co-workers at my last workplace! (See my [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/search/?query=lxd][notes on lxd]])

- Understanding python's [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/posts/20221231140207-python/#imports][import system]] has done me wonders
- =pudb= with =ipython= is pretty neat for debugging
- I don't have any linting, formatter preference honestly I just use the defaults that work with my editor setup. If any project needs specific style, the CI/CD system should catch it.

      - [[https://quii.dev/HTMX_is_the_Future][htmx and Alpine]] pair well together, htmx is for syncing client side actions with the server effectively within the [[https://hypermedia.systems/book/contents/][hypermedia model]]. AlpineJS (or _hyperscript/vanillajs) are better for purely front end needs.
    - [[https://thinkingelixir.com/petal-stack-in-elixir/][Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView.]]

- I once tried doing react+vite+storybook with all the right config and other stuff, later I felt that I don't want to be worrying about a static site so much. So static sites or semi-static sites are basically an org-mode export or a next.js site for me now.

Absolute dump. I use the [[https://f-droid.org/packages/de.onyxbits.listmyapps/][List My Apps]] app to generate the csv, the csv is then uploaded to dropbox from where airtable pulls it. When generating the org file my custom script fetches from airtable. I did not want this to be a rube goldberg machine but there doesn't seem to be a very clean way out in the way I need it at the moment.
