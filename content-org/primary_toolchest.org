Absolute dump. I use the [[https://f-droid.org/packages/de.onyxbits.listmyapps/][List My Apps]] app to generate the csv, the csv is then uploaded to dropbox from where airtable pulls it. When generating the org file my custom script fetches from airtable. I did not want this to be a rube goldberg machine but there doesn't seem to be a very clean way out in the way I need it at the moment.
