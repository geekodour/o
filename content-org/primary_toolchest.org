* General development
#+begin_lft
- Online sandboxes: [[https://codesandbox.io/s/][CodeSandbox]], [[https://stackblitz.com/][StackBlitz]], [[https://replit.com/][Replit]], [[https://glitch.com/][Glitch]]
- [[https://lobste.rs/s/dfmiko/using_github_copilot_for_unit_testing][Using AI tools]] for [[https://lobste.rs/s/iualxr/ai_enhanced_development_makes_me_more][development]].
- Checking how [[https://golang.testcontainers.org/][test containers]] and [[https://containers.dev/][dev containers]] compare to my LXD workflow
- Re-start OSS contributions, start maintaining some projects [[https://github.com/jubalh/awesome-package-maintainer][and packages]] of interest.
- I am planning to write some aliases and function wrapper around ffmpeg and imagemagick for regular stuff. Most probably there are good tools out there, have to check.

Now how I do development has varied over the years. But I am constantly updating it. This section is a scratchpad area for links/notes about current or probable future workflow.

** Editing text
- 95% doom emacs(heavily customized), 5% neovim
- I think I spent half of my year last year fighting with emacs, had me learn little bit of elisp and I am not sure if it was worth it, but if there's one thing I cannot live without, it has to be =org-mode=. helluvadrug.
- For documentation lookup inside emacs, =eldoc= (using =elglot=), =M-x man=, =dev-docs= custom bindings for =eww=.
- When I quickly need to check the contents of a repo, I use [[https://github1s.com/][GitHub1s]], pretty neat stuff.

** Interface and dependencies
- =fish= is my shell, have a love hate relationship ngl.
- =pacman= and =paru= mostly have me covered
- For different versions of stuff, I use =asdf= + =direnv=. I really like the global, local flexibility that =asdf= gives.
- For virtual environments, I use =LXD= system containers with a custom cloud-init script. It's pretty neat. Thanks to the co-workers at my last workplace! (See my [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/search/?query=lxd][notes on lxd]])


* Domain specific
** Web
#+begin_lft
- Experimenting w websockets, WebRTC, WebAssembly, webworkers other web engineering fun.
- Experimenting w serverless functions (Mostly cf workers)
- Really grokking HTTP, Headers, Cache, Cookies and Sessions
- Getting better at Typescript
- Experiment w [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33218439][htmx]], alpine.js(more) and [[https://svelte.dev/][svelte]](not so much).
- Also want to try out [[https://thinkingelixir.com/petal-stack-in-elixir/][Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView.]]
- Explore more in web security side of things
#+end_lft
#+begin_coolinks
- Info: [[https://caniuse.com/][caniuse]]
- CSS & Animations: [[https://css-tricks.com/almanac/][Almanac]] | [[https://animista.net/play/basic/scale-up][Animista]] | [[https://svgartista.net/][SVG Artista]]
#+end_coolinks

- Everything I learn here becomes obsolete in about six months
- But I like the web and I want to build on it too
- I am too bad at anything involving CSS so, tailwindcss is my best friend here.
- I once tried doing react+vite+storybook with all the right config and other stuff, later I felt that I don't want to be worrying about a static site so much. So static sites or semi-static sites are basically an org-mode export or a next.js site for me now.
- I think I learned react about 3 times and everytime, the documentation gets overhauled(good thing). But the last time I learned react, I [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/search/?query=react][took notes]].
- Don't ask me about framework preferences. I don't think I agree with myself here.
** Python
- I use asdf + poetry for all my python virtual env setups. Even if it's a project with a =requirements.txt=, I use poetry to create a venv there and pip install on it. I don't think i'll ever understand python virtual environments completely so I am going for the path of least resistance
- Understanding python's [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/posts/20221231140207-python/#imports][import system]] has done me wonders
- =pudb= with =ipython= is pretty neat for debugging
- I don't have any linting, formatter preference honestly I just use the defaults that work with my editor setup. If any project needs specific style, the CI/CD system should catch it.
- Once [[https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#][joblib]] was very useful to me but I can't exactly remember when
* Data
** Database
#+begin_lft
- Experimenting more with: SQLite (and ecosystem), Postgres (and ecosystem), Clickhouse, DuckDB, Redis
- Go through the excellent MySQL intermediate series by PlanetScale
#+end_lft
- I don't play with DBs on the daily but plan to.
** Data Engineering
#+begin_lft
- Checking [[https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar][centerofci/mathesar]]
#+end_lft
** Data Analysis/Viz
#+begin_lft
- Including [[https://www.desmos.com/][Desmos]] and [[https://observablehq.com/][ObservableHQ]] in my workflow
- Use more of [[https://datasette.io/][Datasette]]
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2054364/firefox-how-do-i-list-installed-extensions-and-identify-them-in-a-list][Getting]] [[https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/jq][better]] w [[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/312697/merge-jq-output-into-a-comma-separated-string][jq]]
#+end_lft
- Airtable has been a good friend, I'll soon go for a selfhosted solution due to limitations in the free tire.
* Infra & Security
** Hosting stuff
- Mostly use github and bitbucket for hosting code repositories
- Netlify or Vercel for semi-static sites
- Have not got around selfhosting stuff yet, except locally on my pi/laptop when it makes sense.
** Infrastructure Management
#+begin_lft
- Try out [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35749366][scrcpy]], [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35749594][sipcalc]]
- Check out [[https://github.com/moul/assh][assh]] for managing ssh stuff
- Experiment w [[https://ghidra-sre.org/][ghidra]], see [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org/posts/20230418153328-reverse_engineering/][notes]]
- Check [[https://github.com/cilium/pwru][cilium/pwru]] looks pretty cool
#+end_lft
- Ansible and Github actions are enough for my regular automation
- I haven't fiddled with infra stuff in a while but it's always a combination of so many things. Shell scripts, custom programs, infra tools, external tools and so on. I plan to streamline this process eventually.
** Troubleshooting
- I have a dedicated page called [[file:plumber_manual.org::*General][Plumber Manual]] for this.

* Non-tech
** Planning/Brainstorming/Curation
#+begin_lft
- I've been planning to setup a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/vt0otx/using_the_power_of_zotero_in_emacs_orgmode_to/][nice zotero & org-ref workflow]] but I am not an academic and I am not exactly sure how things will play out.
#+end_lft
- =org-mode= supremacy, notion and various markdown wiki veteran.
- I have a page dedicated to [[file:o.org::*Notetaking][notetaking]]
- Github issues and Linear for project progress tracking.
- Key is to think how to think about the specific problem and choose tools based on that. Meta.
** Communication and Discussions
- I have a [[file:personal_lists.org::*Communities][communities]] page but I have serious [[http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html][problems]] communicating my thoughts, but that's another story.
- Chat
  - Matrix: Element as the backend, cinny as the chat ui
  - IRC: [[https://thelounge.chat/][The Lounge]] runs locally on my pi
  - Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, Discord
- Email
  - Gmail, Zoho Mail (K9, Delta Chat) w [[https://simplelogin.io/][SimpleLogin]]

* Misc
** Art/Design
#+begin_lft
- Experiment more with MagicaVoxel
#+end_lft
I wants to do art/design but not at the moment. I also wanted to make weird game videos using assets etc (Neel, if you ever read this, yeah still at it). But I might have to pause that for a while as it does not directly feed into my primary goals but I definitely want to make time for it.
** AI/ML experiments
#+begin_lft
- [[https://huggingface.co/][Huggingface]]
- [[https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index][jerryjliu/gpt_index]], [[https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain][hwchase17/langchain]], [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35349608][gpt4all]], [[https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui][oobabooga/text-generation-webui]]
- whisper.cpp, llma.cpp et al, [[https://lobste.rs/s/prfiun/web_llm_runs_vicuna_7b_large_language][Web LLM]] looks pretty sick.
#+end_lft
- When SD came out, played a lot with [[https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui][AUTOMATIC1111]]

Absolute dump. I use the [[https://f-droid.org/packages/de.onyxbits.listmyapps/][List My Apps]] app to generate the csv, the csv is then uploaded to dropbox from where airtable pulls it. When generating the org file my custom script fetches from airtable. I did not want this to be a rube goldberg machine but there doesn't seem to be a very clean way out in the way I need it at the moment.
