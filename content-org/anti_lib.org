#+TITLE: Anti-Library

#+attr_html: :class book-hint info
#+begin_quote
an [[https://www.antilibrari.es/][antilibrary]] is that collection of books you know a bit about, but have not read, and the latent potential of all the wonders they may hold. We can extend the same idea to other media, too ‚Äî essays, films, websites, and so on ‚Äî anything you might learn from.

How is the anti-library populated?
#+end_summary
Anti-library sort of is just a fancy term for bookmarks in the way I am using it. It falls in the capture phase of my [[file:o.org::*Notetaking][notetaking]] process. I use =org-capture= to manage these notes and there's some custom css which help color the status of the items in this page.
The supported statuses can be found [[https://github.com/geekodour/dottedflies/blob/566aa2a3524f5b705cc9ce9a0564fc64e759decd/.config/doom/org-mode-config.el#L127][here]]. When making entry for [[file:o.org::*Monthly notes][monthly notes]], we shall discard =FINISHED= and =DROPPED= items from the anti-library. If I make any notes they'll be available in the [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org][wiki]]

I've exported this page just to have the information public, otherwise this page is managed and used inside emacs, i have =org-agenda= templates which picks things up from this list to put them in my agenda.
