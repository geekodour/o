#+TITLE: Anti-Library

#+attr_html: :class book-hint info
#+begin_quote
an [[https://www.antilibrari.es/][antilibrary]] is that collection of books you know a bit about, but have not read, and the latent potential of all the wonders they may hold. We can extend the same idea to other media, too — essays, films, websites, and so on — anything you might learn from.

#+begin_summary
How is the anti-library populated?
#+end_summary
Anti-library sort of is just a fancy term for bookmarks in the way I am using it. It falls in the capture phase of my [[file:o.org::*Notetaking][notetaking]] process. I use =org-capture= to manage these notes and there's some custom css which help color the status of the items in this page.
The supported statuses can be found [[https://github.com/geekodour/dottedflies/blob/566aa2a3524f5b705cc9ce9a0564fc64e759decd/.config/doom/org-mode-config.el#L127][here]]. When making entry for [[file:o.org::*Monthly notes][monthly notes]], we shall discard =FINISHED= and =DROPPED= items from the anti-library. If I make any notes they'll be available in the [[https://mogoz.geekodour.org][wiki]]

I've exported this page just to have the information public, otherwise this page is managed and used inside emacs, i have =org-agenda= templates which picks things up from this list to put them in my agenda.
