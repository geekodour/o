This website be my homepage and this page is its [[https://hacdias.com/colophon][colophon]]. Here I've listed why the homepage is the way it is, its structure and some ideas behind it. Check [[*Locus 🌊][Locus 🌊]], if you're looking for an overview of all the personal things I host publicly.
#+end_quote

** Why have a homepage?
I have absolute zero game on words but I consider myself an opsimath and autodidact. I have an extremely bad memory and my knowledge about most things is pretty shallow because I never really threw myself into the deep end of things.

But I am changing that, the homepage(and my wiki) are core part of my thinking process. They help me clear random things off my mind and let me focus on what's important, the moment. It really works! The chaos has reduced by significant amount after I started writing out documents for silly things that occupy my mind.

The way I organize, use and consume digital information, I need some place where I can host notes about things that I want to take a look at some later point in time, /organized in specific ways/. A simple homepage was the perfect fit for my needs, a wiki would have been too dynamic. It is also useful to present a cached/discounted version of me.

Also, I know it's stupid but like I cannot be fully me in social media, but here? you can't downvote me! this is my space i'll say whatever i want, one can judge me all they want, but it does not matter to me. I can wriTe like This? don't care. i can also write like this? also don't care. I CAN WRITE LIKE THIS TOO? NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD. i rite liek dis? do not fucking care. I swear a lot? [[https://www.reddit.com/r/effinbirds/][yes please]].

** Site Structure and Organization
The [[https://github.com/geekodour/o][source is hosted on GitHub]]. It's a couple of org files exported to markdown with awesome =ox-hugo=. The site is then pushed to the forge and netlify picks it up from there. I love my current workflow the most compared to all the other previous blogging workflows.

I can’t claim to have originated many of the ideas [[https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/8760-hours.pdf][here]]. It builds off many hours of reading many articles and blogs and other things, which are attributed when possible.

** Things I want to add later
*** General Ideas
- [[https://hacdias.com/guestbook][Guestbook]] : It's something where you site visitors can leave a feedback.
- Currently this webpage is served over HTTP, and [[/index.xml][feeds(/index.xml)]]. Want to host it and make it available in more funky platforms like Gopher, Gemini, IPFS, tor net etc.

*** Review/Long form explanatory style articles
- want to write long form explanations like https://ciechanow.ski/gears/ and https://fasterthanli.me/articles/face-cams-the-missing-guide
  - My personal blog at blog.geekodour.org is not super suitable for this.
- Additionally, I would like to summarize some papers/books I read.
  - Eg. https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/06/always-measure-one-level-deeper.html
- Most of my stuff, like homepage, wiki and blog is for self consumption or vomit. This would be more for the public kind of writings.
*** Shit ideas
- [[https://tonybox.net/posts/simple-stl-viewer/][A Simple STL Viewer with Three.js]] : Add something like this, want to put out some terrible things
- A collaborative movie watchlist manager: I cannot watch movies alone. I want to have a small webapp where one can enter =(suggestion name, suggestor name, secret)= and make an entry. Once an entry is made, I get an email about it and we can schedule watching it together offline. using netflix party or something. Use your nick and not your real name if possible if you don't want your name to appear on this website!
*** Personal Meta Search Engines

*** Quantification Ideas
I plan to quantify a lot of things. I only want to quanify things I can act upon, so I'll not just quanify anything for the sake of quanitifying. Following is a badly formatted idea dump related to quantification that I would like to explore sometime in the future.

I am having a headache tonight so I am not going to write this.
** What are you studying?
- Studying things in bulk is almost gone, from now on everything should mostly be incremental study and learning things from experiments and experiences of trying to make things happen
- I made a study topics to projects to work on mapping that I really like. (I think this has been running for several months now but I am not super happy with the progress but there has been some progress)
** What are you thinking about these days?
- I am thinking about a name for the space I am going to turn my house into. Pretty excited about it. AlwaysCookin', Petrichor(?)
- I am also thinking about funding sources for this space as it's a physical space and will be quite busy when operational, there are quite a few sinks here and there.
- I am also thinking about how do I switch to the things I think I'll really enjoy etc. It's complicated I'll probably write a blogpost on this one of these days.
** What did I do this time?
I've learnt my lessons, this time around fortunately I can safely say that I'd not taken any fucked up decision so far.

🍜💰 Contents of this page sort of describes how I plan to [[https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2020-09-20-On-the-use-of-a-life.html][use my life]]. It's both personal and public. Personal because it lists all my desires which I really want to make happen. Public because it also lists in ways I relate to this world and the ways I want to contribute to it.

I have spun myself 25 times around the sun at the time of this writing and tbqh, I am the dumbest mf I know and I do not have a [[https://dkb.show/post/life-is-not-short][lot of time]]. I cannot be the baddest-X on the planet, cannot work/research on something that will revolutionize some domain, the trade-offs will not be worth it for me. I've been lost in life before and I do not want to be lost again. This document is sort of like the reference I plan to keep coming back to, to iterate, to extend, to modify.

Motivations behind:
- To see if what I have in mind is actually something good or it is pure shit.
- To have a good enough plan ready to get started, if all of this is of any good.
- This will also make it easy to get feedbacks and improve.
- Outsource planning and thinking of goal/purpose/direction to my past self.
- Planning is important, prioritization is importanter, I cannot get shit done otherwise. We plan because we have shit we want to do with our lives. So plan.
- I do not think strategically by default, more so for long term goals. So this document is sort of necessary for me to be functional.

My ultimate goal is to leave this planet better than I found at my capacity and live a life I am proud of. For that as mere mortal, I'll have to play my part. Since I cannot encompass the whole of things, I have spent time thinking about:
- What are the areas I can make the most [[https://www.todepond.com/wikiblogarden/blending/goals/community/][impact]] in?
- What are the areas that I really want to contribute to?

The intersection of these two is what comprises this page. My idea about how the world works is naive and I do not understand all the critical analysis people often do. If someone is able to create happiness and satisfaction for themselves in a sustainable way so that all the entities around are also happy. That's the life I want to live. I apply this to myself and want to scale it. While working on this I hope to learn how to navigate the world better.

Lot of nice people are doing amazing work in these areas in the right direction, more than I'll be able to do in ten lifetimes. On top of whatever I do, making the work of these people more visible, structured and accessible is something I'll be actively working towards.

** Master Plan

#+begin_summary
What do I feel about all this?
#+end_summary

Let's be honest, having a masterplan is pretentious as fuck. What is this? Fast and furious movie? But I've spent time thinking about this, making a master plan is the only way I see to organize my life. Things I want to do are spread across too many areas and are connected. I'll make proper attempts, if I fail I'll let it go but not without trying. Also I feel like I might be re-inventing the wheel in many cases, in those cases me being aware of it and making use of it will count towards completion of the goal.

I am not really happy with the fact that all of this seems a little too vague to me and I wrote all this to gain clarity but I think I'll figure that out eventually. A [[https://twitter.com/neilshroff][galaxy brained friend]] once told me, /"bro, you probably just want to start a religion"/. It's funny because it's true and that's the last thing I want to do but if clarity leads to that, be it. Also, what matters is only often clear in hindsight, so will reflect.
#+end_details

Our ancestors and fellow humans did a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history][lot]] for us. The infrastructure we have today is nothing less than magic to me. But there's always something to do, something important to work on.

Following is a list of goals divided into buckets of 5, 10 and 15 years which I believe are worth pursuing for me. Some of these blue-sky long-term stretch goals are overly ambitions but these give growth to independent secondary goals which are shorter, less ambitions and easier to estimate for. I am constantly dreaming, thinking, experimenting and learning more about the spaces these goals are set in.

I am open to all kinds of changes to these goals as I become more aware of what's up. Things are *expected to fail*. Whether to accomplish these time-based or goal-based depends on the goal itself. All of this is just a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_O5YHX4urE][rough outline]] and I *do not intent to make this too granular* as I feel that will make it less useful.

*** Building blocks
These are ideas that are directly/indirectly are the building blocks of the goals. I am not sure if these are my projections.

- *Quality of life* : People deserve better, if it can be improved, it should be improved. Work at individual and community levels. Changes need to be at social fabric level by raising the lowest common denominator directly.
- *Curiosity, Freedom and Creativity* : Freedom and curiosity are precursors to doing great creative work. We must allow people to take creative risks. Pay the price of freedom for the people who can't afford it.
- *Call out* : Stupidity that harms others must be called out and flamethrowed at. Fuck casteism, fuck these scammers calling themselves ed tech giants.
- *Beautiful imagination that works* : It has to work, that's the point but beautiful imagination is not secondary. Bigger beautiful things happen when people contribute beautifully at their individual levels.
- *Proper resource allocation* : Allocate the right resource to the right thing at the right time. It's important to decide whether we allocate humans to problem spaces or solution spaces. I think most problems we face today is because we fucked this up. Should take care of it proactively and yet keep room for experimentation.
- *Common knowledge* : Make common [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal][knowledge]] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records][actually]] common. We have this wealth of human knowledge and history that we're not able to pass down to the next generation effectively. Education should automate this. Education will not solve everything but I'll be damned if I do not try.
*** 1 Year
- [ ] Lay the groundwork for research and experimentation
- [ ] Study relevant areas in cs, se, math, economics and education
- [ ] Build the required pipelines for note-taking, execution and money
- [ ] [[*Agenda:2022][Agenda:2022]]
*** 5 Years
I'll be experimenting with one single city/town/place. If things work, I'll try scaling it whenever I feel like we can scale. It's harder in a city like Guwahati because people are not so much online in the right places compared to a city like Bangalore. But I guess I'll be experimenting with Guwahati.
- [ ] Generate enough capital so that I can go on for the next 10 years without having to look for a fund to support myself personally. The way I plan to do this is listed in [[*Gandhi ₹][Gandhi ₹]]
- [ ] Start a 24x7 local community library not confined to books. Anchor for promoting discussion of the [[https://dynamicland.org/][futures]] we want for the locality, and how we might achieve them. A home for all kinds plausible creations in the space.
- [ ] Seed the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LocalWiki][Hyperlocal]] + [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_technology][Low Tech]] + [[https://lobste.rs/s/adeuhl/offline_is_just_online_with_extreme][Offline]] first movement
- [ ] I'll need to navigate and lobby institutions to get what I want. Be aware of all the legal aspects/permissions, government bodies, established private institutions for it.

Audrey Tang's take on government technology:

/My existence is not to become a minister for a certain group, nor to broadcast government propaganda. Instead, it is to become a "channel" to allow greater combinations of intelligence and strength to come together./
#+end_quote
- [ ] Work towards shifting the focus areas of local schools and colleges to what matters. I am not 100% on the NEP'20 but it's a step in the right direction, but it is just the specification. The implementation and support for the implementation is lacking severely.
- [ ] Extend the work on open access information and publication in general
- [ ] Do [[https://early.khanacademy.org/][long term research]] in education and have a way to [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38160079][experiment with it]] at the same time. At the end of 5 years, I should be able to define the problem of the Indian education system based on my research.
- [ ] Do knowledge [[https://www.inkandswitch.com/][experiments]]
- [ ] Work towards making public information more structured and accessible and pave the path with which the information itself flows to the people who need it the most.
- [ ] Monitor the state of the education system and see what is making things worse, what is making things better etc. Build custom systems and frameworks, leverage existing infrastructure.
- [ ] Lay the groundwork for building an [[https://news.columbia.edu/news/stacks-project-johan-dejong][evergreen system]] that catalogues everything education, with proper taxonomy and discoverability.
- [ ] Make archival of local things mainstream than ever. At the least, I'll archive shit lot of things myself.
- [ ] I have no idea how to deal with the [[https://erikareinhardt.com/personal-climate-action][climate crisis]] and I'll probably not be able to contribute directly in proper ways, but I am probably some [[http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/][good at]] information management. So I think I can make effective information more accessible for the general public and people working in those areas. Work on how to make things more proactive, work with [[https://github.com/philsturgeon/awesome-earth][organizations]] to channel their funds etc.
*** 10 Years
Not too many new things to do. But will collaborate a lot because I think I might have something to offer by then.
- [ ] Reflect on the work done in the last 5 years. Decide if this masterplan should be burnt or extended. Continue working on it, if all good, else kill self.
- [ ] Now that I have a better idea about the problem of education in India, start working on describing possible solutions
- [ ] Extend the library if it works out
- [ ] Start a education research lab if any of the research done was significant and demands a lab
- [ ] Start an alternative education system
- [ ] Start the computer science museum eventually
- [ ] Collaborate a lot
*** 15 Years
I feel so stupid trying to write my task list for 40yo me. Brave of me to assume that I'll even exist. But just will roll with it for completeness sake. I think my interests will shift totally, but [[https://sive.rs/horses][we'll see]].
- [ ] Keep working on improving what was built previously or gracefully shut things down.
- [ ] Do a lot of drugs
- [ ] Work towards making research less dependent on institutions. Power to the people doing independent research.
- [ ] Fuck the narrative of you can't help everyone. There are people who don't need help that's fine. But if there are people who need help, it's our collective responsibility as humans to help them kickstart
- [ ] See how we can accelerate [[https://kk.org/thetechnium/what-everyone-knows/][fast science]].
- [ ] Following is [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34485254][Bret Victor's]] long term goals. See if I can contribute to any of them:
  - [ ] Revolutionize how people learn, understand and create
  - [ ] Give scientists the tools to diagnose and cure world's ills
  - [ ] Give artists the tools to create and share beauty in ways currently impossible
  - [ ] Reform our infrantilzed society
  - [ ] Give people tools to resist and destroy consumer culture
  - [ ] Give people tools to resist and destroy the corporation's oligarchical control over employment, entertainment and creativity
  - [ ] Return power, dignity and responsibility to the individual
** Operation plan
This section is about how I plan to execute all of this. I spent time understanding how my brain works and how can I make it do what I want. I must say my brain is a sneaky mf who likes to do all the things I should not do and a world champion at forgetting things.

Anyway, I plan to work on all of this using two frameworks:
- Framework to organize information
  - Helps me think and prioritize.
  - Has pipelines for different kinds of information
  - Organizes itself by design. See [[*Notetaking][notetaking]]
- Framework to execute experiments
  - Helps me experiment things easily and quickly.
  - Lets me ship, test, track and tear things in a graceful manner.
  - Allows me to scale things if required.
  - This is mostly the infra and local tools that I use. I've not build this framework properly yet hence no document about it exists at the moment.
  - Allows me to work on multiple projects at once
  - Idea is to make the system such that, even though I haven't worked on something for a while, when I come back to it, the efforts put into getting back into it should be minimal. In other words, tries to simplify what [[https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/10/06/new-talk--making-hard-things-easy/][jvns]] mentioned in her talk.

"When you use a system very infrequently and it's full of a lot of weird trivia and gotchas, it's hard to use the system correctly."

** How to approach mentioned goals
When picking any goal, do the following:
- Ask:
  - What exactly do I want to achieve?
  - How can I measure success?
  - Am I actively seeking out information about this?
  - Can I break this down into more manageable parts?
  - Is this really my goal? Or is it just some projection, am I constrained by fears or uncertainties?
  - What's awesome/dope about this?
  - What would this look like if it was perfect?
  - What is that you want to add/change here?
  - What are some questions I return to related to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_science][this area]]?
- Don't(s):
  - Assume nothing will go wrong
  - Make long term goals if possible
  - Estimate time on long term goals
  - Assume you know exactly what to build
  - Implement anything without thinking real hard
  - Plan more carefully if it's a [[https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/07/15/long-term-plans-dont-work.html][long term goal]].
  - Add a larger margin of error on timed tasks
- Do(s):
  - Try keeping things simple

This is not a syllabus and learning things is not so linear as presented here but I just wanted to lay out an outline for reference if I ever get lost again. Of-course I am not pressuring myself to learn all this and there's no priority here, these are general subjects that i am interested in.

Following is directly copy pasted from [[https://www.hybridcalisthenics.com/programs][Hybrid Calisthenics]], use this [[https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/cnzs21/confused_by_all_the_fitness_terms_i_wrote_up_a/][glossary from /r/bodyweightfitness]] to understand technical terms better.
- **Strength**
  - To get stronger, we must progressively challenge ourselves with harder exercises.
  - The more often we ask our muscles to contract near their maximum voluntary capacity, the stronger we get.
  - Therefore, pure strength programs will focus on:
    - high set volume
    - low rep volume
    - high resistance
  - This way, the individual can pour as much strength into each rep as possible.
- **Muscle**
  - To get more muscular, we must fatigue our muscles.
  - When we bring our muscles near failure, this triggers a growth response.
  - It’s interesting to note that science doesn’t fully understand exactly how hypertrophy (muscle growth) functions. We just know that it does based on empirical data.
  - Although resistance doesn’t necessarily need to be as high as it’d be in a pure strength program, enough resistance must be present to activate and fatigue our type-2 muscle fibers. They have the most potential for growth!
    - low set volume
    - high rep volume
    - moderate-high resistance.
- **Fat Loss**
  - This has more to do with our diet than our workout program.
  - To lose weight, our caloric intake must be lower than our caloric output.
  - A good overall training program will help you burn more calories, optimize your hormones, and increase functionality.
  - However, if you’re training hard and not losing as much fat as you’d like, you may need to adjust your diet.
- **Stamina**
  - Although often used interchangeably with “cardio,” building our muscular stamina can be a separate pursuit.
  - Our endurance is somewhat activity-dependent. For example, being able to do high-repetition pushups does not mean we will be able to do high-repetition squats.
  - Many programs can be used for muscular endurance, but these usually involve high set volume, medium rep volume, and medium resistance.
  - If you just want to feel your heart pumping, high repetition squats or bridges will do the trick. You can also explore things like hill sprints.

You can’t fight a problem when you don’t understand it. So understand what you're getting inside your body. If you want to improve, you should have a visceral level of disgust against your bad eating patterns([[https://letsharden.substack.com/p/are-ya-eating-good-son][h/t ankit]]). Work out and eat at the same times every day. this helps instill discipline and trains your body faster. I also want to explore some [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38109778][biohacking]] stuff.
*** Nutrition
**** Calories
- A calorie is a unit of energy. The traditional calorie is equal to about 4.2 joules
- The calorie you see listed on food packaging is actually a kilocalorie, or 1000 calories, so it's equal to about 4200 joules.
- When a food item has a measurement of calories, it's saying /"this is how much energy this food item will give your body."/.
  - But that's not entirely true because it's the amount of energy in the food, not what your body can get from it.
  - Additionally, cooking sort of changes the calorie you get out of the food.
#+attr_html: :class book-hint info small-text
#+begin_quote
- First you add other ingredients to the food while cooking
- Secondly cooking partially breaks down the food making it easier to extract the calories of the food. So since you use less energy to get the energy from the food you net more calories. Extreme examples of this is eating beans uncooked which results in your body getting nothing out of it. They're designed to not be digested. Even if you chew them thoroughly, they're filled with chemicals whose only purpose is to stop you from getting any nutrition from them(antinutrients). Boiling them fortunately destroys these chemicals so that we can access all that nutrition.
#+end_quote

- When you say you're burning calories, you are literally converting them into co2, heat, and water like when you burn wood, just at much lower temperatures.
**** Types of calories
There are four types of calories. The first three are necessary for human health, but the last (alcohol) is not. Each individual food item is usually made up of a combination of these. For example, an egg has both protein and fat.
- **Proteins**
  - These are the building blocks for your muscles and body.
  - If you are working out, you want to have plenty of proteins to build up your muscles. That’s why body builders always use protein shakes.
  - However, proteins turn to fat by the liver if you consume too much of it (or you are not working out) and if your body doesn't use them.
  - =1g of protein = 4kcal=
- **Carbohydrates (or Carbs)**
  - These are the energy source for your activity.
  - Take Carbohydrates before intense activity like running or gym sessions.
  - If Carbohydrates are not "burned" during the activity following your meal, it will be stored as fat.
  - =1g of carbs = 4kcal=
#+attr_html: :class book-hint info small-text
#+begin_quote
*More about carbs*
- Carbs are a family(saccharides) that contains sugar but also complex carbs and fiber.
- The most important statistic for your health about a type of carbohydrate is the Glysymic Index (GI). The GI will tell us how fast that type of carb is absorbed by the body. The faster the absorption rate the higher the spike in blood sugar.
- Carbohydrates can be broadly divided into 3 groups: simple carbs, complex carbs, and fiber.
  - *Simple carbs*: These are mono- and disaccharides such as table sugar (sucrose which is =glucose + fructose=). These are absorbed quickly by and cause a rapid spike in your blood sugar which results in a rapid spike in insulin levels. (Bagged Sugar, Fruit Juice, Honey, Cake, Soda, etc)
  - *Complex carbs*: These are longer chain polysaccharides (literally =many glucoses chained together=) which take longer for your body to digest. This leads to a slow and steady increase in blood sugar and a slow and steady increase in insulin levels which can be well managed by your body. (Oatmeal, Beans, most Veg.)
  - *Fiber*: This is an insoluble form of carbohydrates that our bodies cannot process. Since it cannot be processed, it will never be absorbed or used as energy and will pass through. But it does play an important role as it helps keep hunger and blood sugar in check.

#+end_quote
- **Fat**
  - This, sometimes labeled as lipids will remain fat in your body.
  - It will eventually be used for fuel when you engage in an intense exercise routine.
  - A minimum fat intake is necessary to keep your body and organs functioning.
  - Normally you don’t really want too many calories from fat.
  - =1g of fat = 9kcal=
- *Alcohol*
  - =1g of fat = 7kcal=
**** Hormones
- =Insulin= is released by our pancreas to help the cells in our muscles and our brains to accept the incoming sugar molecules from the food, regulates blood sugar.
- =Leptin= is released by out body when we have eaten enough food to go work i.e when we are full. If =Leptin= is not released you'll keep feeling hungry.
- =Ghrelin= signals your brain when your stomach is empty and it’s time to eat. =Leptin= decreases your appetite, while =ghrelin= increases it.
*** Weight gain
Some notes paraphrased/copied from the internet. Please don't take these as advice.
- Eating more is the only way you can gain weight.
- If I am not gaining weight, I am not eating enough and not reaching a calorie surplus.
- No matter what my food logging app says, if I am not gaining weight, it means I am not eating enough, I should eat more.
- Track trends over months/weeks instead of daily, body weight keep fluctuating on a daily.
- Your calories has to be reflect your volume and your goals. Getting bigger is no different than getting stronger or becoming a better athlete in terms of principles. You eat for performance. And if your “performance” is getting bigger (more muscle mass) than you have to eat enough food to illicit recovery and to give your body fuel.
*** On lactose
=Lactose intolerance= is a very common digestive problem. Those who have it don’t have enough of an enzyme called lactase, found in the gut. Lactase is needed to break down lactose, the main sugar found in milk.

After 23 years of living, I realized that my body does not play well with milk. Conventionally, in our family milk is the poster boy of a healthy diet. Now that I know better, I try to avoid milk. Here are few tips for myself.
- Basically go for lactose free products.
- Paneer is a better substitute than milk for the lactose intolerant person. If Paneer is a block, break/crush the union and wash it with water and squeeze out the water. Several washing should reduce lactose.
- Yogurt gives you the same nutrition as milk without being too acidic. milk is good but not in excessive amounts. Most yogurts contain live bacteria that can help break down lactose, so your body has less to process on its own.
- If I ever consume whey protein, make sure to get the low-lactose protein powders.
*** Pantry goodness
#+attr_html: :class book-hint warning small-text
#+begin_quote
I did not section the following into breakfast, lunch, snacks etc. as the food tracking app I use does that already. Instead I keep this list for my convenience because I get very confused about what should I eat at any given time, which is why I sometimes end up not eating anything when nobody around me is there to suggest eating something.

These food/ingredients are accessible to me or I can cook them kind of.
This is like my menu to my own resturant which is my kitchen.
This is not a recommendation at all.
#+end_quote

- *Cold Drinks*: Lemonade
- *Lite snack*: Omelette with butter and vegetables

I am the last person to take any financial advice from. Everything under this page is only for me based on the risks I can take and how stupid I can get. If you have any suggestions on how I can allocate my assets better, please feel free to ping me about it. Always happy to learn.
#+end_quote
** Background Notes
- Focus on what can go wrong and take care of it first.
- It's important to do financial planning and goal setting so that you can stop thinking about money and focus on learning, building things and career growth. This will lead to satisfaction as I gain satisfaction from learning things and at the same time, it will help maximize my income.
- Having too many options will cause analysis paralysis.
- Equity investments can be also be compared with growing gardens and trees. You can either acquire that skill or you can hire a gardener to do that for you. They key point is to have patience.
- Learn when and how to exit, setup watchers for exit. Not knowing how and when to exit is like having the best water bottle in the world with a small hole. Asset allocation strategy is closely linked to withdrawal strategy.
- Savings does not mean putting that money into your bank account, it could also mean investing it somewhere etc. creating assets that can give you direct value when needed.
- Build the life of your dreams and then save for it.
- Lifestyle inflation refers to the common phenomenon of increasing spending shown by people as their income increases.
- Time billionaire : One billion seconds is 31 years (a career). If you have 31 years time of life, you're a time billionaire. I am 25 now, I am currently a time billionaire if not a money billionaire.
** Allocation
*** General Notes
- I'll try to save 75% of my primary monthly income for the next 5 years.
- With better incomes, lesser spending and more focus, the rate of savings will increase. Earn more, spend less. Most basic rule of saving.
- If you have an impulse to buy something online, put a pause of 72 hours before you place the order. If you want to buy things you want, you have to save.
- It's always good to start early, in my first year of job because I had no one telling me what to do with my money, I managed money very bad. It becomes, since I don't know what to do, I will do nothing. It was very stupid of me to do nothing.
- For the dumbass that I am, the only formula I use to plan anything is the [SIP formula](https://cred.club/calculators/sip-calculator). There are three variables, =p=, =r= and =t= . As mere mortals, with hard and smart-work we can change the value of =p= . =r= and =t= are up-to sky homie. So I'll try to optimize =p= and make sane and safe decisions for =r= to be decent.
- The biggest factor for financial independence is not your income, it is **a sustainable savings rate**.
- Ideal portfolio should be diversified not just asset-wise but also geographically.
*** Distribution
- 60% defensive stocks (Diversified Indexes, Bonds, Debt)
- 25% slightly aggressive stocks (Picked Equity)
- 5% Crypto
- 10% build hedge (Cash, FD, Gold, Silver, Bitcoin)
- Emergency Funds
  - 1L Immediate support fund
  - 5L kit-kat break from life support fund
**** Why hold some liquid debt funds
- FDs are safe, but you can't pull the money out if you need it immediately.
- Equity can be volatile, but you can pull out the money. If there is an emergency someday, based on the nature of the emergency you might have to sell things at a loss because you need the money, even if you know for a fact that the stock will be going up sometime in the future.
- Holding some money in a debt mutual fund allows you to always have certain amount of liquid money as they allow you to get your money back quickly. Liquid debt funds are also less volatile compared to equity, so chances that you'll be at a loss is probably less.
*** Savings Buckets
**** Bucket Instant Gratification (0-5 years)
Money that is needed in 0-5 years goes here
- Aim for 8-9% returns on these.
- When subscribing, make sure to check for taxation and exit load etc.
- These money go into liquid funds and FDs
**** Bucket Delayed Gratification (>5 years)
Money that is needed in 6-7 years goes here
- Aim for >10% returns on these in the long term.
- Since this is long term, subscribing for tax benefit plans can come here.
- We can go aggressive here, because it's long term and we don't care if things do down in recent times. It's the long game. We can take big bets about the future.
** Insurance
- Always buy pure health insurance and pure life insurance, never go for the combo ones.
- Prefer direct plans over going through some agent.
- Take the terms up-to 60 years, because after 60 years, your investments and your savings should cover your ass, otherwise you might as well die.
- Health: This should be more correctly called sickness insurance.
- Life: This is more of a income replacement insurance and not a life insurance. i.e. When you die and your income stops, this will supplement your income for your family.
** FIRE
How much money you need to retire is called your FIRE portfolio
- I'll be going with **SWR(Safe Withdrawal Rate)** : Estimated percentage of savings you're able to withdraw each year throughout retirement without running out of money.
- It only includes invested assets that generates income. It is not your net worth.
- If annual expenses(tax incl.) = 12L (Monthly 1L)
  - WR(withdrawal rate of 4%) = 12/0.04 = 300L = 3Cr
  - 3Cr/12L = 25 years, with 3Cr, I'll be able to live a 12L/y lifestyle for 25 years.
- If annual expenses(tax incl.) = 9L (Monthly 75k)
  - WR(3%) = 9L/0.03 = 300L = 3Cr
  - 3Cr/9L = 33 years, with 3Cr, I'll be able to live a 9L/y lifestyle for 33 years.
- 3% WR is considered safe and my expense rate should be around 9L/y
- So **3Cr is my FIRE portfolio**, whenever I hit 3Cr, I can quit my job and working anymore for good. While talking to some people I realized that 3cr is nothing for them but it's more than enough for me.
- I plan to save 75% for the next five years. But to stay safe, I've put 60% savings in the following screenshot.

*Update '24*

It's 10th Jan'24 today, my 2022&2023 agenda did not go as expected.

But I have few no-compromise goals this year
- Get fit and Reduce screentime (<45m/d)
- Start making money off of what I like doing.
- Form the habits I always wanted to form (life/study/experimentation)
- Start winning and take care of things (esp. those which are due)

*Update '23*

It's 19th Jan'23 today, my 2022 agenda did not go as expected. I'll not make an Agenda:2023 this year.

I intentionally put some crazy expectations so I am not freaking too much about it. But I am happy with my progress in different aspects in my life in 2022. Professionally, I did not upgrade myself as much, but trying my best to make up for it now. I need to make this happen for myself.

I think I should seek help but not yet. Therapy will be my last resort but at the same time Plan B is not to fuck this up. /on my momma, on my hood, i look fly, i look good/.

** Introduction
file:agenda_damage.jpg

what the year is *not* about:
- not about doing a lot of research.
- not about making a lot of money

what the year is about(ordered by priority):
- about making your mind and body healthy
- about building pipelines for inspiration, planning, execution and money
- about going back to the fundamentals
- about fixing human relationships
- about building things that puts me in the habit of building
- about putting myself in a position where i can help myself and others if required
- about taking long term bets

All of this is also based on the fact that accomplishing my goals in "certain
[[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qwdupkFd6kmeZHYXy/build-small-skills-in-the-right-order][ways]]" will bring me true joy(i am pretty sure about this one). 2023 should be
the year when the research finally starts happening, where the real money
starts flowing in. In this process there will be a lot of study, practice,
failures, experimentation, careful operation and ruthless prioritization.


** Why?
April'22, got diagnosed of adhd. writing this in June'22 and still
haven't got my meds. It's that bad. But what I ultimately realized is that my
strongest issues are with:
- *retention of information*: do not retain shit, recall seems fine
- *extreme procrastination*: will tell you someday later
- *extreme dependence on mood for productivity*: dependence on things that i do not have complete control over yet
- *quickly getting overwhelmed*: terrible management of energy and time

based on my [[https://www.adamgrant.info/Being+Human/ADHD/Strategies/Answering+messages+by+first+and+last+day][quirks]] and specifics all of the above can be addressed with proper
note-taking(at-least it'll be a sensible start)

Last year('21), i watched a [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCldvV9TWPPGM0kRB91G7w/featured][lot of videos by Russell Barkley]] on adhd, which
made me doubt if i am a goat here. Based on recent diagnosis, information i
gathered from the videos and past experimentation/experiences i have decided
that i need to change certain things so that i do not face such difficulty in
doing simple day to day tasks.

  i am writing this in June'22, but the year still ends for me in Dec'22.

other things:
 - I am no longer going to spend my time and energy revolving around other things.
 - I am focusing on myself, and people i care about. Once that's taken care of we'll move up.
 - I tried my best to carefully craft my environment this time, it’s not perfect but good enough. I have optimized my environment for:
   - *Happiness:* so that i can get into a good mood as fast as possible.
   - *Peace of mind:* taking care of my family so they can take care of themselves and it'll not be a constant worry in my head.
 - This time it probably should work, I have been consistently failing at this goal thing since '16. My wins should be spectacular for myself and nobody else.

I found this [[https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223792859469320192][awesome table by shreyas on twitter]], i found it very relatable to how i am trying to fix my life, so i wrote a slightly modified version of it for me:

about lifestyle(🐦):
#+begin_quote
The preferred lifestyle should dictate your business decisions, not vice versa.
- Work is something you do that lets you earn minimum necessities
- Your business should improve your life
- Variable income is a good stressor
- Try different things & find out your preferences
#+end_quote

** Moats
- *Friends:* Make friends in general. Make friends with people you’d generally not hangout with. Make friends with people all around the world, with people from cities you want to visit. learn how to effortlessly take care and nurture friendships.
- *Fixes:* Fixes need to be internal rather than external. Not leaving any thought unaddressed.
- *Balance:* Do not seek work life balance, seek something you would happily sacrifice work life balance for. You won’t need balance that way, you’re the balance mfr.
- *Execution:* Under promise and over deliver. Create value for myself and for other people.
- *Uncomfortable with self*: Imposter syndrome is subjective and manifests itself differently for different people, for me it's what @hillelogram mentioned on the bird site. It's stupid but I feel like an imposter because I never was able to transform the cool side project ideas into reality.
- *To think:*
  - [ ] Identify my craft, it's definitely not programming. Maybe it's a lot of things.
  - [ ] Start becoming so good at "something" that you can teach people about it.
  - [ ] Define my worth
- *To improve:*
  - [ ] Analytical abilities
  - [ ] Creative abilities
  - [ ] Execution abilities
  - [ ] Competitive abilities
  - [ ] Attention to detail
** Goals
These are my goals for 2022:
*** Basic Human Goals
I basically checked myself into Maslow's hierarchy of needs, my actions need to align with my needs:
- [X] *Health*: Get yourself checked, check off possibility of any immediate danger
- [X] *Personal security*: Add security cameras at home
- [X] *Emotional security:* Fuck emotions, become god
- [ ] *Financial security:* Make enough.
- [ ] *Family/Friendship/Intimacy/Trust/Acceptance:* Be real, be around real
- [ ] *Cognitive needs*: Be around more curious people. Explore.
- [X] *Aesthetic needs*: Let it flow for myself.
- [ ] *Self-actualization:*  What a man can be, he must be.
- [ ] *Transcendence needs:* one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself. This is what I came to realize when I asked myself what's the meaning of life real hard.
*** Better Person Goals
These are things I’ll not be deliberately practicing, these are things that changes me as a person so I just need to be aware of these things.
- [ ] Gratitude
- [X] Discipline
- [ ] Active listening
- [X] Anger control
*** Mental Habit Goals
- [ ] *Document:* Journal/Document everything including mood. (Self Quantification)
- [ ] *Reading:* Read books/papers/blogs, take notes.
- [X] *Sleep fix:*
  - [X] 8 Hour sleep
  - [X] Socials offline, 1 hour before bed and 1 hour after waking up.
  - [X] Wake-up with a mission, go to sleep with a plan for the next day and the mission. Clear your mind and body once you wake up.
- [ ] *Understand perspective:* Look at anything from at-least 3 different perspectives.
- [ ] *Hard things:* Do hard things daily, learn to use my tools(including phone) to the fullest.
*** Physical Habit Goals
- [ ] Get Fit
- [X] Fix posture
- [ ] Quit smoking
*** Skill Goals
- [-] Learn
  - [ ] Swimming
  - [ ] CPR, Basic first aid
  - [X] Guitar
  - [ ] Whittling
  - [ ] Pixel Art, Basic drawing
  - [ ] Lockpicking and stealing
  - [ ] How world works(economics), Business, valuation.
- [-] Improve
  - [ ] Math
  - [ ] DS & Algo
  - [ ] General programming practices
  - [X] Security posture
  - [ ] P2P, Dist Sys
  - [X] Shipping shit
*** Whole Goals
These goals are vaguely defined by intent, these does not corelate to doing some task or doing a set of tasks. When these things will be done, i;ll know and then i can check them off. Here I mention of building two frameworks, one for ideation and one for execution.
- [X] Write the masterplan. Have only one plan, no backups. Roadmap it 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. (starting: 25yo, ending: 40yo). After 40 you should not be worrying about planning things.

I've [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DshRUOm-o][a huge memory problem]], i forget everything eventually so to retain information, note-taking is essential. This is a real problem for me, on top of that, years of constant use of social media has affected me in ways that i do not like.
#+end_quote

Some random quotes on memory and notetaking that I like:
#+attr_html: :class small-text
#+begin_quote
- /So much of what we call creativity and intelligence is just memory. - Unknown/
- /Notes aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. – Richard Feynman/
- /What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. ~ Herbert Simon/

** ICCES Loop
Let me introduce my very own ICCES loop. tbqh, i just put that abbreviation to sound cool, it's absolute shit. It is specific to how i function. On a regular day, this is happening to me in all kinds of ways so i decided to sort of formally define it here. It's a set of actions that can be applied to certain entities. Part of the reason this works for me is probably because I enjoy using it.

| Action      | Example entities                                              |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inspiration | Things that I am curious about, things that excite me         |
| Capture     | Link, Feeling/Moment, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Task, Question |
| Consume     | Link, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question                       |
| Execute     | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question, Task                       |
| Share       | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Feeling/Moment                       |

This by definition does not have a start and or end and can occur while reading some section in a book or while taking a shower. One is free to use any technique/tool to do the action on any of the entities.

*** Inspiration
For me curiosity and inspiration are more of less the same thing. They drive action. Without inspiration or curiosity, I can't even get started and if I am not curious about it, why even start.
- 🎵 : Podcasts before sleeping are great for inspiration. I use them as a proxy to get into hard and new topics. Pick some podcast where they do casual talk about some hard topic, makes me feel like huh, I can do that too(obviously I can't). But that kicks in the inspiration.
- 📚 : Casual reading of random topics
- 🍞 : Letting my mind just frolic into things.
*** Capture
Because we want to make unified operations, we will avoid application level capture. In other words, we want to *avoid* using twitter bookmarks, HN saved, browser bookmarks etc. Capture most of the time would be a secondary activity when you're doing something else. We would also want to link new captures to existing notes. When we take notes, we should ask: /“In what context do I want to see this note again?”/ when setting *tags*.
- 🖥 : org-capture, org-mode notes, org-roam.
- 🏃 : telegram dump channels(Journal =2d=, Links =1w=, Memes =1w=, TIL/TIFU =1w=), camera, screenshots
- 🐉 : multimedia into respective google drive
- 🔔 : prioritize at entry

#+attr_html: :class book-hint info
#+begin_quote
note:
- plan to make a hybrid-image-board which should move my dependency on google drive
- till we don't have a good visual-board/image-board solution built, pinterest is a good substitute
#+end_quote

*** Consume
Before consumption it is important to re-organize/re-order information for consumption. When consuming, it should be the primary activity. We also re-prioritize things at this step because it's the only sane way to decide what to work on.
- 📅 : periodically re-view, re-think, re-organize, re-prioritize captures.
- 🐝 : place information where it will be easily accessible while executing. eg. put things into anki.
- ⚒ : build tools to help re-organize captures.
- 🍲 : actually consume, study, think, summarize. recurse.
*** Execute
Execution is the most important part. Creating content out of your notes is natural spaced repetition.
- 🍎 : apply what you consumed to something useful
- 👉 : take it the next level/form of it. write that post, ask that question, ship that project.

#+attr_html: :class book-hint small-text info
#+begin_quote
Some ways to execute:

Conversations • Essay • Recorded video • Mind map • Specialty document (PDF) • Pitch deck • Presentation • Talk / lecture • Group discussion • Product strategy • Object • Poem • Song • Memoir • Theater • Apparrel • Monologue • Video (AV) • Printed design • Zine • Culinary • Architecture • Interior design • Photography / art direction • Image • Token • Currency • Business • Syllabus • Interactive experience

[[https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/04/19/new-playground-integer-exposed/][jvns knows what's up]]
#+end_quote

*** Share
Sharing is caring, share the good energy as much as you can.
- 🎷 : talk to people about what they are doing, learn from them. share your ideas.
- 📜 : share what you feel freely in which ever medium you prefer.

- If taking physical written notes, can use Google Keep to convert them into digital notes which would later go into ~org-roam~.

** Spaced repetition
With amazing search engines we do discover things quickly but as fast as the speed of thought? idk about that. Occasional resurfacing of concepts is super important for me. I DO NOT trust my memory at all. It betrayed me countless times, now my only best friend is spaced repetition.

My biggest weakness is probably the fact that I cannot survive in an unstructed world and real world is mostly unstructed. I tend to re-shape things my way before I even begin to work. So it took me a while(way longer than ideal simply because I never gave it more importance) to find an ideal spaced repetition flow.

file:me_sleeping.jpg

Me at 18. Used to make sticky notes that I revised each morning and evening. Only later when I was lacking I realized how effective they were but they were hard to manage and everything. After a couple of years, I came across Anki and used it on and off. Eventually I started using emacs with org-mode and it had a very nice integration with Anki which made me re-consider for the long run this time.

- I am using [[https://github.com/eyeinsky/org-anki][org-anki]] and I have AnkiDroid on my phone. (tip: don't use spaces in deck names)
  - The actual anki application should be running for it work from emacs.
  - Files are stored at =~/notes/org/anki=, each file is a deck.
  - I want to keep these files version controlled, so if you update any Anki deck from somewhere else, make sure to import that deck first in emacs before making any changes to it.
  - 2024 update: Using org-anki is limiting, so started using anki directly.
** Context switching
- Lot of my time *and energy* actually goes into context switching.
- Now that'll I'll be doing different things throughout the day, I need something that will ease up the switch. That clears up my mind for the new tasks, that removes any [[https://www.uwb.edu/business/faculty/sophie-leroy/attention-residue][zombie thoughts]] from the previous task.
- Internet suggests batching similar tasks together and performing some ritual if it's a hard switch so that the brain realizes it's time to switch.
- My ritual for hard switches: Wash face and legs, sit comfortably, listen to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2DUpDxFJyg][gravity falls theme song(40s)]], mini stretch, get started.
- If coming home from outside, first thing you do is put house clothes on and wash yourself. *This is very important for me.* Otherwise I am stuck in some loop.

* A normal day
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: day
:EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: docs/documents
:END:
This document essentially documents that way of life, some principles, some
rules for myself and how i plan to spend rest the year. In other words, this
document is simply a manual for an year long experiment.

** Meta ideas
- *Right mindset:* instead of saying "i'll solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
- *Practice:*
  - Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted.
  - Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
  - Do [[https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/26/variable-mastery/][mixed practice instead of block practice]]. eg. practice after finishing the book(mixed) vs practicing after finishing the chapter(block). This way we use much more cognitive power.
    - Blocked practice (practicing the same skill under the same conditions) leads to more rapid gains in performance but limited transfer when variability is introduced.
    - Random/Mixed practice (adding variability and interleaving practice types) slows learning but improves retention and transfer.
- *Be real*:
  - Don’t [[https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm][fool yourself]]. Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities.
  - Having a team can bring those projections down.
- *Pomodoro:* In the sessions where it's pure learning, make sure to use the tomato technique 🍅
- *No snooze:* if possible, never postpone what's on agenda, never snooze
- *0 days:* if it's a habit, no zero days
- *Hard things:*
  - Do hard things daily so that hard tasks become regular task. break things down.
  - If something seems too hard, create a simpler version of the problem.
- *Study:*
  See [[*Taking study notes][Taking study notes]]
- *Build/Apply:*
  - If learning, build something out of it. A product, a poem, whatever.
  - At the least, list 2 things that can be built with the new knowledge.
  - Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. Apply chunking.
- *Procrastination:* It's a habit that affects many areas of life. Just start, that's the trick.
- *Complex things:*
  - Often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.
  - You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
- *Sleep:*
  - Sleep is part of the learning process. Consume new information and let your brain rest on it, so that you can learn on top of it. Don't fuck w it.Incremental learning, otherwise it's like building a wall without letting it dry.
  - Sleep also affects my mood, so it's extremely important for me to get right amount of sleep.
  file:./images/me_sleeping2.jpg
- *Context switch*: See [[*Context switching][how to context switch]]
- *Habit:*
  - Habit is an energy saver! no need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.
  - Once your brain starts expecting a reward only then will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.
** Guidelines
- *Building & Learning cycle:*
  - =2 weeks of building= then =1 week of learning= cycle will keep my mind sane.
- *Reminders*:
  - Because the list of capture keeps growing, remind self to consume something everyday.
  - Remind self to do spaced repetition. when coming back to some info, try recalling it without looking at it, re-read only after you recall. Recall references too.
- *Meetings:*
  - Only happens if they are on agenda
  - Try keeping less meetings either way
  - Tune people out. demand too much effort? feeling not so good about it? cancel it.
- *Entry:*
  - Any day, other than Friday; 💻
    - Plan next day at the *end of the evening of the working day* (easier to disconnect, be present)
    - /"park facing downhill"/ : Leave work in a state where there's an obvious and easy task to start the next day with.
    - Use =anti_lib.org= and =syllabi.org= to fill /study/ and /consume/ sections in the agenda.
  - If Friday; 🍺
    - Plan next week on the *evening*, go into weekend with a clear mind
    - Sync =syllabus.org=, =syllabi.org= and =anti_lib.org=
** Daily agenda
*** Calendar and Schedule
- Day outline: [[https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZDg1MmFlZjcxMmRmMGNjN2UyZTYxMTY4MmFkMTI3NjJhNDM1NzUyNjM0ZjhmMzg5ZWRlZWQ2Mzc2ZTljNWZiOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t][Google calendar link]] | [[https://github.com/geekodour/notes/blob/main/org/l.org][Org file(l.org)]]
- We have a ouline of the day, the source for that is always =l.org=. It's not prone to frequent change. I do not plan to change it in atleast 6months. It's on repeat, exported to =ics= and imported to google calendar as =ouline= calendar.
- New tasks for =org-agenda= will go in =tasks.org= if I have to create one from my laptop. we have the custom =daily agenda= view that I created(which will not contain external google calendar events).
- Otherwise, I am allowed to create events in my own google calendar and use the calendars together. This gives me best of both worlds.

*** Weird things
Now it might be stupid to have such rituals but I decided to live life a certain way for which I am giving up on certain things, I have accepted that there are some things that i'll never do etc. etc.
- [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12eXM621XwEEdSQA3ejXL2hlcUXWJvOhY/view?usp=sharing][Morning Ritual]]: Basically puts the day into perspective. I [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.blockbasti.justanotherworkouttimer/][use this]].
- [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ebO12LPOeOSqpyEAr3YzpURri0tVCb4/view?usp=sharing][Night Ritual]]: I had this feeling of not doing enough, not knowing what's going on etc. Now that feeling is normal and infact sometimes the fact but it does not help. Putting some kind of closure to the day helps.
- Power nap: I usually don't need this, but sometimes it's different(I cannot describe how different) and I need to sleep for a while. Dreams are super weird when this happens but I think sleeping is sort of the way out of that weird feeling that I feel some afternoons.
- [[*Context switching][Context switch ritual]]
- If I am stressing out. drink water < double breathe in+lookup to the bulb < go for walk < boiler room music+try to focus < sleep < take a break for a day < eat favorite food < call a friend < cry < re-think life.
*** Daily management tools
Because I get zoned out of my life so much, I need help all the time. After a fair amount of experimentation, I've settled on this set of tools just to manage time and energy.
- *Habits*: Using [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/][loop habit tracker]] for tracking things that I consider habits.
- *Time tracking*: I did not really need a time tracking but at the moment I am actively trying to make progress in [[/docs/updates/syllabi/][16 different subjects]] and I can't really measure individual progress so easily because some things are related to work, some are purely interest and so on. But keeping track of time will help me see if I am leaving any subject behind, if i am not paying enough attention to some subject(ofc prioritization has its own place). For time tracking, I am using [[https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.samco.trackandgraph/][Track & Graph]].
- *Distractions and Pomodoro*: The [[https://www.forestapp.cc/][forestapp]] is great, I bought the pro one and works nicely when it comes to handling phone distractions for me.
- *Task management*: Any new task pops up, if in emacs it goes to =org-capture= to =tasks.org=. If not, write it in paper/board/phone notes app and later transfer it into =tasks.org=. Once that is done, we plan for the next day each day and we plan for the next week each friday. Then use =tasks.org= to fill appropriate sections of the day in my personal google calendar.

I am comfortable living with myself and spending time alone and I try to create an environment for myself where I can thrive. I've been through some shit and I am still recovering, so I am not yet available for everything and everyone but I plan to be more social eventually. From past experiences, things usually go south when I step out of my bubble and interact with the world. So I've listed things I know about myself that are helpful when working with me, both for myself and others. These are [[*Why?][important for me]] so that I can keep being functional. I took +inspiration+ copied shit from amazing [[https://manfred.life/howto-manfred][manfred]] and nice [[https://www.brendanschlagel.com/collaborate/][brendan]] while creating this page.

file:colab.jpg

I don't have a full time job +and not looking for one /as of the moment/+. My ideas about creating money are listed at [[*Gandhi ₹][Gandhi ₹]]. In certain cases, I plan to get some bread though collaborations. *I am open to all kinds of collaborations*, specially crazy ones. I like juggling hats but also big fan of going down the rabbit hole and not returning to the surface for weeks. I've listed some thoughts below which might help you decide if you'd want me to collaborate with you/your team.

In summary, I like to build software, analyze data, think about information in general, research education, consult and write. I also enjoy collaborating with niche communities.

Additionally, if you just want to have a casual chat about something we both are interested in or just want to tell me that I am full of shit, I always appreciate those conventions.


** Strengths and Specialties
This list is volatile, I'll keep updating this frequently.
- *Data* : In my past, I've solved problems related [[https://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/][to data wrangling]], In other words extracting data out of some source and putting it somewhere and in some way where it makes more sense.
- *Tools* : Building tools and automation, big fan of building custom tools. Be it woodwork or writing set of shell scripts to do taxes for your brother in law which also collects metrics about his kitchen garden.
- *Right thing* : Extreme focus on doing the right thing vs doing the thing that gets the job done now. I picked this up while working at [[https://clarisights.com/][Clarisights]] and still improving at it.
- *No bloat* : Figuring out no bloat solutions to problems related to content management and knowledge management. I have special interests in proper organization, using the right tool for the job, building new tools if things don't fit the exact requirements, delivering the most upto-date information to the consumer and having proper archival mechanisms.
- *Writing* : I am actually pretty bad at writing but the love for writing is so much in me that I totally consider it a strength. I am actively learning to write better.
- *Research* : I have never actually done any research for anyone else but I happen to figure out whatever I need, whenever I need it. I plan to have a more proper way of thinking about this so that I can do the same for others.
- *No knowledge, no worries* : If I am interested, even if I do not know anything about your domain or stack, I'll quickly pick things up and get myself upto speed so that I can compliment what I have to offer, but now specific to your domain.
** What I absolutely cannot contribute to
These are things I do not wish to delve into in near future, but might in the far future.
- If your project involves AI/ML. I probably would have no idea about how I can make any contribution to that area.
- If it involves hardcore embedded development and electronics. I probably would have no idea about it and would probably have somewhat of a hard time figuring things out.
** Interest Inventory
This body of interests also indicates a [[https://www.infraculture.org/2021-12-30-an-inventory-of-interests/][path of discovery]] which has been found and promises a lively time in the future. The things that I keep coming back to most of the time revolve around education, humor, social issues, climate issues, optimizing things for happiness and stability, making regular things suck a little less, things that need solving now, total re-thinking of how something is done. I have varying amount of knowledge in the areas and every experiment is a new learning opportunity. :)

#+attr_html: :class book-hint info
#+begin_quote
There is more to be done in the following up of these interests than can be accomplished in a lifetime. So I keep track of all [[file:projects.org::*Directory][my ideas in public]] and am open to collaborating with teams doing similar things. The internet is a serendipity machine and if sharing things publicly helps me find the right people to work with, it's a win. I like small teams who work on specific things to accomplish [[https://patrickcollison.com/fast][ambitious]] goals that work. If you or your team is working on anything related to the my interests and is looking for someone to collaborate with, I am very much willing to learn more and be an active participant.

- *Local* : Projects related to Guwahati/neighboring places, which aim to make the city better in small ways. Also open for classes, workshops and other local events(doesn't necessarily have to be technical).
- *Data* : Data gathering, analysis and visualization. Specially geospatial, time-series and social data.
- *Writing, Archival and Curation* : Writing content specific to my interests, curating lists and libraries, for everything from independent curricula to businesses. Building proper archival and backup systems for the same.
- *Small Tech/Low tech/Small data/P2P* : Boring, playful, [[https://100r.co/site/mission.html][small]] and [[https://localfirstweb.dev/][offline first]] technologies and standards, I am interested both in the development of these standards and extending the usecases. I like the [[https://indieweb.org/][indieweb]] and what the folks at [[https://small-tech.org/research-and-development/][small-tech]] are doing.
- *Cybernetics, creative tooling and communication* : I am interested in how we can help make our communications better using new mediums.
- *Consulting* : I love collaborating on fun, ambitious, random experiments on the internet and offline. I try to understand the experiment and then let you know how I can be helpful and then go ahead contribute to the areas I can contribute to.
- *Education* : I am a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz#Open_Access][big proponent of open access]] to learning resources and an outright hater of the evil edtech giants and flop traditional institutions in India which manufacture [[https://archive.is/6MF1J][crushed]] kids every year here in the country straightup leading to misery. I am willing to work on this area in all fronts, be it calling out bad actors, creating new information products, researching how we can learn better, experimenting with custom learning tools, campaigning, indexing research for other researchers, you name it. I have a lot of respect for [[https://www.khanacademy.org/][KhanAcademy]].
** Communication
I like interacting with people but I like it more when they get to the point right away. In other words, not a small talk enjoyer. I am a big fan of humor and total believer in being serious without a suit. So cut the formal shit, just get to the point, If there's something I can help you with, I will do everything in my ability to be helpful to you because I just want to be somewhere where I can help and my help is needed.

I don't care if this sounds stupid but look at the above image and just recall how insignificant we are. Humans created something called money and started valuing it, making it way of communication, creating economies around it, making it the way how research gets done, making it the driver of showbiz and what not. It really be just something humans believe in and built overlay products, instruments and theories on top. I don't think money is bad or anything, but like it's just as real as our imagination.

You can technically decide to not believe in god because you can exist without it as your life is not run by god. But if I live in this economy and tell I don't believe in money, I'll become what they call broke. Simply because money runs it. I already have this life that's mine and I constantly feel like the world is trying to sell my own life to me. My dog once ate a ₹2000 note and then started smiling at me.

But now I am addicted to it, I cannot go back to the jungle and become unalive the next day when the friendly noodleboi decides to kiss me. So it's apparent that I have to play the money game whether I like it or not. So, if I am going to play and I know there are no rules, I can decide how I want to play. I do not have to select a template, I can create customized gameplan that fits my needs. So that's what this page is about. It's not unique but it's custom, and boi do I love me some customizations. I have a feeling that after a while, I'll be like fuck this customization just give me a template, but at this moment and I am excited and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLhuPD2ASKE][we roll]] till that happens.


** Why do this?
Discovering new ways to make money is fun, particularly when it comes to building sustainable revenue streams for creative work. There are few folks I found on the internet who create money in their own way and they seem to be really enjoying it (atleast from the outside). I might not have 1% of the talent as [[https://daniellebaskin.com/][this person]] but I really like what they do and how they be making money out of it, they basically sell products and experiences to people around the world, nothing too fancy but pretty cool.

If we talk about mantras and shit, I understand that marketing plays a huge role but I am slightly more inclined towards the just do good work and people will start noticing school of thought. One of the core ideas is that making money should be a side-effect of what I do.

So let's see how this goes, I am going to experiment this for the next 3-4 years and if nothing works out, I can confirm that I was a mega stupid(which I am) when I was 25.

** Economics
I have to study economics. I have 0 knowledge in the area but the way I am planning to work around this area is better described by Andy Matuschak in his homepage:
#+begin_quote
/My methods meander between academia and Silicon Valley: I explore theories by expressing them in real-world systems, which produce insights I use to improve the theories, which I use in turn to improve the systems, and so on./
#+end_quote
So once I have a better idea of the following and things start rolling, I'll extend this section with more formal details about how everything is working together.


Following are the hats/feathers/badges(🎩,🐦,📛) that I plan to work with. With a scattered brain and such optionality, I myself can see that is the perfect recipe for disaster but honestly do not have a lot to lose. On top of that I'll be extensively documenting everything so at the least a stupid case study will come out in the end. Funny thing is I have not started working on any of this, but I guess some planning was necessary If I plan on doing so many things, these things align with the [[*Masterplan/Roadmap/Goals][masterplan]].

/Hustle and grind. Create 7 streams of income. Work 18 hour days - anything less and you're a loser destined for mediocrity. Read 5 books a week. Start trading stocks and crypto. Take cold showers, hit the gym. Optimize your schedule, log every minute spent. Ditch your loser friends and only hang out with likeminded - success breeds success. Sigma grindset. Moon or bust. If you're not worth $1 million liquid before 30, cut off your finger and work even harder. Analyze your productivity and always look for places to cut fat. - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o7qjN3KF8U][HN Comment]]/

- *Builder* : [[https://austinhenley.com/blog/programmingasplay.html][Build]] [[https://www.reddit.com/r/Artisan/][anything]] and try to monetize it if possible. This will probably be my primary source of income as of the moment. From what I see, it's not easy at all but should be worth it. Be a craftsman of sorts.
- *Independent researcher:* R&D on tools for thought and the Indian education system
- *Internet writer:* Writing regularly in areas of interest
- *Data journalist and Internet Detective:* Churning out data and presenting them in a more accessible manner if I come accross any such cases
- *Activist and Social worker:* Active Activist in areas I care about. I feel like Activism is effective in certain areas that I'll be working on but lot of it is done in in-effective ways or maybe too late or something. Also all humans should be social workers, like you're responsible for keeping your room clean, not sure why we made it a tag.
- *Business owner:* Not trying to be the cool entrepreneur here. Pure baniya style businesses just to undertand how things work around here. I think there's not too much risk in this.
- *Collaborations:* Collaborations are pretty cool way to make money I think, you meet new people, have fun and also make money [[https://github.com/sdg-1/consulting-handbook][in the end]]. I've written extensively about [[*Collaborate][how I want to collaborate here]].
- *Local information curation* : I do not know how I can describe this role well enough but it's basically collecting local and geographical data and making it useful for people who can benefit from it directly, now.
- *Occasional House cleaner:* I think cleaning is my true passion but apparently not a lot of money in cleaning. But I still can do it for relatives and friends.

Even though I am concern about making money here. I am ready to trade money with anything else which will help me reach my goals.

** Fund me
I will probably keep some fund me links here if I ever feel like the work I do is giving back or it is creating significant value. Till then here's my [[https://www.amazon.in/hz/wishlist/ls/H8N5KHWU23K3][Amazon wishlist]] if you're feeling generous.

Extending the [[https://nintil.com/categories/links/][lists]] idea by nintil, I have decided to publish monthly summary of everything I did in that month. This will be useful for me in various ways because I have an extremely fragile memory and this should probably help me re-organize things better in my head also probably easier recall, who knows.

#+attr_html: :class book-hint info

It's just be a work of re-organizing and summarizing. Sources for summarizing are as follows:
- =org-journal= or travel entries for the month from [[https://diary.geekodour.org][diary.geekodour.org]]
- links that were finished/dropped from [[file:anti_lib.org::*Posts][anti-library]]

** 2022
*** July
The whole month of July has been a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYt4tKNTP0][wack]], I don't want to write about it or what I did this month or what I learned this month, I am doing absolutely fine but the month only sucked. I'll write proper summary from next month.
*** August
This was my birthday month. It was pretty interesting. I started off with a lot of enthusiasm that this is the month that I am going to start doing all the shit I always wanted to do. I had the perfect agenda and everything I followed through the first 2-3 days and things quickly became wobbly.

Two major things got flagged off, finally started proper work on [[https://www.instagram.com/ahdultcomic/][@ahdultcomic]] and my [[https://betterkeep.co][first side project]] after a break of more than three years. My best friend left the city so I hardly ever went out and just stayed inside my house the whole month fiddling around different things. Also started working on various other projects. I did some reading and some writing as-well. On the learning side, did a lot of frontend and general systems design stuff and yeah the guitar.

Watched a movie called /Everything Everywhere All at Once/, it was pretty pretty great. Thanks to Anubhav.

Sort of finished one book about end of life planning. It's called /In Case You Get Hit by a Bus/, read this for some reconnaissance on betterkeep, did not finish it as got what I wanted before I finished reading it. Also took some notes.

Read a lot of blogposts throughtout the month, did not keep track, the only ones I have link for:
- [[https://www.spakhm.com/p/tech-stack][Tech stack - by Slava Akhmechet - Zero Credibility]]

Published some writings on my blog:
- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/landing_page_notes/][Landing Page notes]]
- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/bip/][Some ideas about building in public(BIP)]]

- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/product_launch_checklist/][Product Launch Checklist]]
- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/cto_checklist/][Lord of all things technical checklist]]

- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/prd-template/][PRD Template]]
- [[https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/arch-template/][Architecture Document Template]]

Overall rating of the month, 6/10. I had some pretty terrible experiences that I cannot mention publicly which weighs down the month by a lot.
*** September
I am writing the monthly note of September on 17th October. Needless to say, the month was pretty fucking hectic for me. No journal entry, nothing.
- We did some progress on getting AhdultComic to speed. The bank really caused so much of issues. We formalized many things about it. Now we have a better idea about what it is and what we want to do.
- Lot of meetings and lot of meetings cancelled and postponed.
- Bought saparscribe.today did not have any fucking idea what to do with it.
- Bangalore got hit by floods
- Cut my own hair by myself for the first time
- Days and nights were full of anxiety for unknown reasons but I kept telling myself otherwise
- Lots of discord calls with friends
- Return of loneliness in life, but said fuck off to it this time
- Started an AI art page where we plan to release the threesixfive calendars later on instagram and twitter. Also planning of creating a discord server.
- Not a lot of progress on betterkeep, but we did make a UX architecture.
- Honestly, lot of time wasted in meeting people for the sake of meeting. Need to reduce meeting people even if I anyway meet less people
- Spent atleast 5 days on the discord server for threesixfive but did not promote it properly yet. Feel like lot of effort went into the wrong area here but we'll see.

Overall rating of the month, 3/10.
*** October
- Started looking out for logistics for threesixfive
- Spending a lot of time on instagram to promote threesixfive, absolutely hating it.
- My friend came in surprised all of us on his birthday
- I finally sorted out my primary and secondary toolchest, big W. It was a lot of manual effort which could not be automated otherwise and long due!
- Little to no progress on betterkeep side, more progress on 365. We fixed a vendor, got paper samples etc.
- The month went pretty fast, because I don't keep daily journal, I don't remember things clearly. But I did go on a road trip to shillong for the weekend.

Overall rating 5/10
*** November
- I moved the syllabus to the homepage and split it better, also understood how i'll like to use anti-lib, syllabus.org, syllabi.org and org-roam, anki, telegram and other tools together. Basically planned on a better, distraction free workflow which works both for work and study.
- I also moved my old wiki to mogoz and moved the history page from old wiki to my homepage. The history page honestly is not funtional at this point but i'll let it be till i create logpad
- Biggest win has to be updates done to [[/docs/documents/day/][a normal day]] and [[/docs/collections/food_drinks/][food and drinks]]. I updated how should my day be like and made it to google calendar exported from org. Secondly, experimented with a lot of tools to finalize by diet and exercise plans. Extemely happy about it. See, these things matter absolutely nothing to anyone else, but for me it's a BIG W. Happy that I am starting to be capable of being happy for my own little efforts.
- There's good progress with threesixfive and some not so good conversations with some partners we're trying to partner up with.
- Going blr soon for sometime yay
*** December
- 1st week went by at EthIndia'22.
- Came back, wrapped everything related to 365 and started selling by 15th December
- Sold few, around 28th my friend left for mumbai, I started writing 365 website on 31st dec.
- No celebrations, rather gloomy

If I had to rate, 2/10
** 2023
*** January
- 365 website finished on 17th Jan, almost two weeks for this. Not happy at all, but was a refresher for many things. Hopefully will be useful.
- Not feeling super cool about things given the current climate of things, preparing myself for the worst mentally, will give it all. Jai mata di.
*** July
- Haha, no notes for last few months. I don't even know what the hell did I do all those months, precisely the point of keeping monthly notes.
- I think I am finally ready to do job hunting now, I am not well prepared or prepared at all. Wait, did I not study 6 months? Well, yes but I studied things I am curious about, not the things that they ask in interviews.
- I plan to apply to a couple of different companies and study for the interviews as I apply. No time.
- I wish I had more time in hand but unfortunately I don't. Gotta run.

I get nerdsniped by myself more often that i'd like, but i still want to keep the question in the back of my head. Other times I am just curious about things and to try it out myself even if the solution to the problem is known to the world. I'll dump my [[https://gwern.net/question][questions]] here.

** Systems
*** How would I really sort a big file?
Sort a 100GB file in 12GB memory. Various approaches.
#+begin_src shell
cat main.cpp | tr a-z A-Z
# vs
tr a-z A-Z < main.cpp
#+end_src

*** Is IFS not Indian Forest Services? (Bash edition)
- This stuff is pretty basic but I don't think I totally get it plus there is some "shell" specific behavior that's weird.
- Also =man 1 read= (fish) and =man 1p read= (posix) are different, what about that idk. fish apparently does not document =-r= but still lets me use it.

** Who am I?
I am a developer with a wide variety of interests and I am [[*Masterplan/Roadmap/Goals][on my way to certain death]]. I am trying to build a large volume of things and also get my fundamentals right. Unfortunately after all these years, I still am in the discovery phase and I guess that's alright.
** Setup
file:setup.jpg
*** Hardware
- *Laptop* : My laptop is my primary development machine. It is a 3 year old ThinkPad E480. I've swapped the HDD for 512SSD and upgraded to 12G memory. I run Arch Linux on it, been pretty smooth.
- *Desktop* : The PC has good enough specs but I haven't started gaming on it yet. It has a RTX3050, 32G memory and a 512SSD for disk along with Ryzen5 3600. Overall good machine 👍. It runs Windows 11 and there are certain cases where I use it for development, going forward I think I might be using my Windows machine for a lot of development work as well.
- *Extras* : I have one UltraWide(29 inch) monitor that I use whenever I am on my desk. For keyboard I have a vanilla Ducky One 2 SF w red keys. Both nice.
- *Phone* : I have one OnePlus9 and a Pixel3A(secondary).
- *Book reader* : I have an old kindle that I never use but plan to use.
- *Watch* : [[https://zeptobars.com/en/read/Casio-F-91W-OKI-quartz-watch][F-91W]], planning to switch to [[https://f-droid.org/packages/org.avmedia.gshockGoogleSync/][Casio square BT G-Shock (B5600, B5000)]] eventually.
- *Sound* : I use this old boat sound bar. Speakers over headsets anyday. I have OnePlus Buds Z2 for on the go listening and meetings. I also have these expensive Alienware gaming headset that I would have never bought myself(got it for free).
*** Lifestyle
- *Place:* I am in Guwahati(obv. can't beat Bangalore weather), the place is great to work from during winters but during summers, no. So in the future I'll plan my summers somewhere other than Guwahati, I'll probably move out eventually.
- *Room* : My room used to be a cattle house. I upgraded the room(Jan'22) to look a little nicer. It has been one of the greatest investments I've ever made. My mood and mental health has significantly improved. I think the room lighting has a lot to do with it as well.
- *Wardrobe* : I always had a minimal wardrobe, I don't have a shoe(my dog ate it), now I just have one pair of rugged flip flops that I use to go on dates to never get a second date
- *Random* : I use a glass drinking water bottle on my table instead of a plastic one. Just feels better. I use stones to light my classic regular 🚬, it adds to the aesthetic needs.
- *Travel* : I save travel cost by not traveling at all. Keeping sunglasses on my table > keeping them inside my bag.

*** Software
I use arch btw. See this [[file:primary_toolchest.org::*Generated][generated]] list for packages.
*** Security
- I carry a picture of a knife on my phone with me all the time. robbers be-aware.
- Single UNO reverse card for extreme situations
- For password management, I used to use pass but then I switched to bitwarden. I am planning to move to selfhosted one soon. I need easy access to my password from my phone.

I shall dump relevant links which will help me understand my systems better here. Make sure to clean up this list and summarize the learnings in some way.

welcome to my homepage, it's mostly मानसिक मूठ siphoned into your brain. Nothing much to say, my name is /jellyfish brained certified cloudhead skinny ol' barman junior the creator of garbage III/. I am pretty friendly, I love nature and I like to simply exist, I happen to do okay things with the computah, also I speak and write broken english. It’s not unusual for me to miss things and be absolutely wrong.

I've written extensively about why this homepage exists in the [[*Colophon][colophon]] section. If you're interested in ruining your good times, check the [[*Collaborate][collaborate]] section.

** What is this page?
I have a [[file:projects.org::*How do I go about building?][projects page]], which is meant for things which I actually intended to do(and failed). This page is more about me itching my curiosity and running side-quests that I must run.
