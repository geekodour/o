I've [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DshRUOm-o][a huge memory problem]], i forget everything eventually so to retain information, note-taking is essential. This is a real problem for me, on top of that, years of constant use of social media has affected me in ways that i do not like.

** CCES Loop
Let me introduce my very own CCES loop. tbqh, i just put that abbreviation to sound cool, it's absolute shit. It is specific to how i function. On a regular day, this is happening to me in all kinds of ways so i decided to sort of formally define it here. It's a set of actions that can be applied to certain entities.

| Action  | Example entities                                              |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capture | Link, Feeling/Moment, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Task, Question |
| Consume | Link, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question                       |
| Execute | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question, Task                       |
| Share   | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Feeling/Moment                       |

This by definition does not have a start and or end and can occur while reading some section in a book or while taking a shower. One is free to use any technique/tool to do the action on any of the entities.

*** Capture
Because we want to make unified operations, we will avoid application level capture. In other words, we want to *avoid* using twitter bookmarks, HN saved, browser bookmarks etc. Capture most of the time would be a secondary activity when you're doing something else.
- üñ• : org-capture, org-mode notes, org-roam, buku
- üèÉ : telegram dump channels, camera, screenshots
- üêâ : multimedia into respective google drive
- üîî : prioritize at entry
#+begin_quote
note ‚úè: plan to make a hybrid-image-board which should move my dependency on google drive
#+end_quote
*** Consume
Before consumption it is important to re-organize/re-order information for consumption. When consuming, it should be the primary activity.
#+begin_quote
What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
/~ Herbert Simon/
#+end_quote
- üìÖ : periodically re-view, re-think, re-organize, re-prioritize captures.
- üêù : place information where it will be easily accessible while executing. eg. put things into anki.
- ‚öí : build tools to help re-organize captures.
- üç≤ : actually consume, study, think, summarize. recurse.
*** Execute
Execution is the most important part.
- üçé : apply what you consumed to something useful
- üëâ : take it the next level/form of it. write that post, ask that question, ship that project.
*** Share
Sharing is caring, share the good energy as much as you can.
- üé∑ : talk to people about what they are doing, learn from them. share your ideas.
- üìú : share what you feel freely in which ever medium you prefer.

** Introduction
what the year is *not* about:
- not about doing a lot of research.

what the year is about(ordered by priority):
- about making your mind and body healthy
- about building pipelines for inspiration, planning, execution and money
- about going back to the fundamentals
- about taking long term bets
- about fixing human relationships

All of this is also based on the fact that accomplishing my goals in "certain
ways" will bring me true joy(i am pretty sure about this one). 2023 should be
the year when the research finally starts happening, where the real money
starts flowing in. In this process there will be a lot of study, practice,
failures, experimentation, careful operation and ruthless prioritization.

** Why?
April'22, got diagnosed of adhd. writing this in June'22 and still
haven't got my meds. It's that bad. But what I ultimately realized is that my
strongest issues are with:
- *retention of information*: do not retain shit, recall seems fine
- *extreme procrastination*: will tell you someday later
- *extreme dependence on mood for productivity*: dependence on things that i do not have complete control over yet
- *quickly getting overwhelmed*: terrible management of energy and time

based on my quirks and specifics all of the above can be addressed with proper
note-taking(at-least it'll be a sensible start)

Last year('21), i watched a [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCldvV9TWPPGM0kRB91G7w/featured][lot of videos by Russell Barkley]] on adhd, which
made me doubt if i am a goat here. Based on recent diagnosis, information i
gathered from the videos and past experimentation/experiences i have decided
that i need to change certain things so that i do not face such difficulty in
doing simple day to day tasks.

This document essentially documents that way of life, some principles, some
rules for myself and how i plan to spend rest the year. In other words, this
document is simply a manual for an year long experiment.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote
other things:
 - I am no longer going to spend my time and energy revolving around other things.
 - I am focusing on myself, and people i care about. Once that's taken care of we'll move up.
 - I tried my best to carefully craft my environment this time, it‚Äôs not perfect but good enough. I have optimized my environment for:
   - happiness : so that i can get into a good mood as fast as possible.
   - peace of mind: taking care of my family so they can take care of themselves and it'll not be a constant worry in my tiny head.
 - This time it probably should work, I have been consistently failing at this goal thing since 16-17. My wins should be spectacular for myself and nobody else.

I found this [[https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223792859469320192][awesome table by shreyas on twitter]], i found it very relatable to how i am trying to fix my life, so i wrote a slightly modified version of it for me:

about lifestyle(üê¶):
#+begin_quote
The preferred lifestyle should dictate your business decisions, not vice versa.
- Work is something you do that lets you earn minimum necessities
- Your business should improve your life
- Variable income is a good stressor
- Try different things & find out your preferences
#+end_quote

about humans(üê¶):
#+begin_quote
Till the time we don't create strong communities, we will always feel alone. It is just mind tricking us in believing that 'I' is the most powerful entity in our best/worst moments.
To create strong communities, we must accept that humans comes in different shades/color/psyche
#+end_quote

** Moats
- *Friends:* Make friends in general. Make friends with people you‚Äôd generally not hangout with. Make friends with people all around the world, with people from cities you want to visit. learn how to effortlessly take care and nurture friendships.
- *Fixes:* Fixes need to be internal rather than external. Not leaving any thought unaddressed.
- *Balance:* Do not seek work life balance, seek something you would happily sacrifice work life balance for. You won‚Äôt need balance that way, you‚Äôre the balance mfr.
- *Execution:* Under promise and over deliver. Create value for myself and for other people.
- *Uncomfortable with self*: Imposter syndrome is subjective and manifests itself differently for different people, for me it's what @hillelogram mentioned on the bird site. It's stupid but I feel like an imposter because I never was able to transform the cool side project ideas into reality.
- *To think:*
  - [ ] Identify my craft, it's definitely not programming. Maybe it's a lot of things.
  - [ ] Start becoming so good at "something" that you can teach people about it.
  - [ ] Define my worth
- *To improve:*
  - [ ] Analytical abilities
  - [ ] Creative abilities
  - [ ] Execution abilities
  - [ ] Competitive abilities
  - [ ] Attention to detail
** Goals
These are my goals for 2022:
*** Basic Human Goals
I basically checked myself into Maslow's hierarchy of needs, my actions need to align with my needs:
- [ ] *Health*: Get yourself checked, check off possibility of any immediate danger
- [ ] *Personal security*: Add security cameras at home
- [ ] *Emotional security:* Fuck emotions, become god
- [ ] *Financial security:* Make enough so that I can buy a car without a loan
- [ ] *Family/Friendship/Intimacy/Trust/Acceptance:* Be real, be around real
- [ ] *Cognitive needs*: Individuals who enjoy activities that require deliberation and brainstorming have a greater need for cognition.
- [ ] *Aesthetic needs*: Humans must immerse themselves in nature's splendor while paying *close attention to and observing their surroundings in order to extract the world's beauty*. This higher level need to connect with nature results in an endearing sense of intimacy with nature and all that is endearing. (bro wtf?)
- [ ] *Self-actualization:*  What a man can be, he must be. Utilizing and developing talents and abilities. Pursuing goals, Partner acquisition(bro wtf? 2).
- [ ] *Transcendence needs:* one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself.
*** Better Person Goals
These are things I‚Äôll not be deliberately practicing, these are things that changes me as a person so I just need to be aware of these things.
- [ ] Gratitude
- [ ] Discipline
- [ ] Active listening
- [ ] Anger control
*** Mental Habit Goals
- [ ] *Document:* Journal/Document everything including mood. (Self Quantification)
- [ ] *Reading:* Read books/papers/blogs, take notes.
- [ ] *Sleep fix:*
  - [ ] 8 Hour sleep
  - [ ] Offline, 1 hour before bed and 2 hours after waking up.
  - [ ] Wake-up with a mission, go to sleep with a plan for the next day and the mission. Clear your mind and body once you wake up.
- [ ] *Understand perspective:* Look at anything from at-least 3 different perspectives.

  - [ ] Shipping shit
*** Whole Goals
These goals are vaguely defined by intent, these does not corelate to doing some task or doing a set of tasks. When these things will be done, i;ll know and then i can check them off. Here I mention of building two frameworks, one for ideation and one for execution.
- [ ] Write the [[https://blog.ayjay.org/tim-cooks-master-plan/][master plan]]. Have only one plan, no backups. Roadmap it 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. (starting: 25yo, ending: 40yo). After 40 you should not be worrying about planning things.
- [ ] Build pipelines for inspiration, planning, people and money. More like the eudaimonia machine but for your mind to work on different things. Includes self quantification.
- [ ] Build a framework where I can test/execute my prototypes super fast. This framework should have max observability and all the nice tools I can experiment in this framework.
- [ ] Practice progressive iteration, create a safe ground so that you can inexpensively re-iterate. be willing to put out a half-baked idea into the world, and use the responses and feedback to continue iterating.
- [ ] Build a whole social media mafia thing, MLM of pages across social media. need distribution.
*** Income Goals
- [ ] Introduce money plugs, making money should be a side-effect of what you do
- [ ] Start passive income, become a passive income mafia
- [ ] By year end, I should be making 7L a month
- [ ] Monetize every skill possible, become a whore for next 2-3 years. Flip things from Indiamart to Amazon. Study different markets, second hand cards going up prices, 1st hand cars prices going down? why. You must have answers, or at least know how to get answers.
- [ ] Build random things and then sell them. Make toys and sell [[https://www.instagram.com/reel/CXgkFf0FgOp/][toys like this]]. Lean toy product design.
- [ ] Do lot of Kickstarter kind of projects, eg. ergonomic stand for computer table. Very lightweight and good looking whiteboard, with magnetic box holder in one corner etc.
*** Random Stupid Goals
Just like a kid.
- [ ] Place ‚Äúhooks‚Äù, make friends with dogs from different localities, make friends with birds and crows. Matrix shit.
- [ ] Get driving license
- [ ] Start some satirical movement like birds aren't real
- [ ] Learn Dad skills (umm, cooking, how to tie knots etc)
- [ ] Become a storyteller, make people excited about your story. Create a narrative, break the narrative.
- [ ] Make eye patch, make pirate cosplay.
- [ ] Solve crime as a detective. Read books on criminal psychology and how to become a real detective etc. Up your reasoning skills.
- [ ] Do 100 random little things and pay attention to how you feel - visa
- [ ] Generate a wild thought pool
** Agenda
*** Meta ideas
- *Right mindset:* instead of saying "i'll solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
- *Practice:*
  - Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted.
  - Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
  - Do mixed practice instead of block practice. i.e practice after finishing the book vs practicing after finishing the chapter. This way we use much more cognitive power.
- *Be real*:
  - Don‚Äôt fool yourself. Don‚Äôt blindly believe in your intellectual abilities.
  - Having a team can bring those projections down.
- *Pomodoro:* In the sessions where it's pure learning, make sure to use pomodoro.
- *No snooze:* if possible, never postpone what's on agenda, never snooze
- *0 days:* if it's a habit, no zero days
- *Hard things:*
  - Do hard things daily so that hard tasks become regular task. break things down.
  - If something seems too hard, create a simpler version of the problem.
- *Build/Apply:*
  - If learning, build something out of it. A product, a poem, whatever.
  - At the least, list 2 things that can be built with the new knowledge.
  - Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. Apply chunking.
- *Procrastination:* It's a habit that affects many areas of life. Just start, that's the trick.
- *Complex things:*
  - Often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you‚Äôre trying to understand.
  - You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
- *Sleep:*
  - Sleep is part of the learning process. Consume new information and let your brain rest on it, so that you can learn on top of it. Don't fuck w it.Incremental learning, otherwise it's like building a wall without letting it dry.
  - Sleep also affects my mood, so it's extremely important for me to get right amount of sleep.
- *Habit:*
  - Habit is an energy saver! no need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.
  - Once your brain starts expecting a reward only then will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.
*** Daily agenda
- Reminders:
  - consume: because the list of capture keeps growing, remind self to consume something everyday.
  - recall:
    - remind self to do spaced repetition. when coming back to some info, try recalling it without looking at it, re-read only after you recall. Recall references too.
- *Meetings:*
  - only happens if they are on agenda
  - try keeping less meetings either way
  - Tune people out if they try to demean too much of my efforts. feeling not so good about it? cancel it.
- *Entry:*
  - plan next day at the end of the *evening of the working day* (easier to disconnect, be present)
  - plan next week on *friday evening*, go into weekend with a clear mind
  - set both starting time and finishing time of tasks if possible
  - When we take notes, we should ask: /‚ÄúIn what context do I want to see this note again?‚Äù/ when setting *tags*.
  - make changes throughout but make commit to notes at time of night journal entry only.
- *Notebook:*
  - Keep a agenda ideas document, keep note of what works and what does not.

the now page
- https://maya.land/now/
      Where did you go?
        Nowhere in particular; I'm still here, mostly wasting time scrolling on reddit these days, less time or inclination to browse the indie web scene.
    Why did you go?
        ahh, the interesting and complicated question. there's no clean answer to it; offline life has taken over in a different direction, working from home has changed my opportunities for wiki'ing, and there's a personal reason or two.
    What are you doing now?
        Spending too much time thinking about work; eating lots of yogurt-marinated chicken in Aldi curry sauce; watching a movie every Sunday; attempting to understand what the point is, as always.
    Do you still care about the things you wrote about?
        of course! if I could retire right now, there would be so many paths for me to curate though my wiki, projects to complete, thought trails to investigate. I am proud of my wiki and it shall remain an interesting artifact on the internet as long as I remember to pay the domain name bills üòÖ
    Are you still doodling, drawing, writing, taking pictures?
        ehhh, not so much as I used to. As I'm paused online, I'm a bit paused offline too; I've been choosing the path of least resistance. sorry, y'all, no inspiring answer here.

there is only certain things i can learn in tths l
ofcourse learning will not be so learnier and well defined but i just wanted to lay out an outline for referece if i ever get lost.

I have other interests but i did not put them here because they are leisure time things and i should not feel pressured them at all

There's no priority in here, these are general popular things that i am interested in.
