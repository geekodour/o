- In elementary school I dated a very nice girl who was a Girl Scout. And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all. And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things, raisin oatmeal, and I said "I'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about $3.50.”  Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. Damn loch ness monster.
- verily I say unto you, no prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you of a truth, many widows were in israel in the days of elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land
- What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

** Reddit
- I'm a senior [[https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/gy6bbp/how_to_approach_software_development_like_a/][dev]] and have accepted that senior doesn't mean all knowing. It means knowing when it's time to RTFM, how to handle complex problems, debugging weird shit and being able to plan and lead the application development and deployment.
** HN
- A data structure can be seen as an interface, a logical structure, a physical layout, or an encoding. When you teach them, you have to start from somewhere.
- Never say "Got it" or "OK" when someone is explaining a problem or solution and you don't follow. It feels awkward to say "Sorry, I'm still not following. Do you mean that when..." five times in the same conversation but it is worth your time and embarrassment to come away with a correctly framed and well understood situation. Otherwise you will figure out what they meant after wasting hours/days/months solving the wrong thing.
- Facing the fact that ideas are ten a penny, it makes sense to see what necessary but perhaps still insufficient accessories an idea needs to prosper. In order of increasing value;
  - an idea
  - a good idea
  - a good implementable idea
  - a good implementable idea whose time has come
  - an invention (the concrete verification of an idea)
  - a design ( a workable invention)
  - a potential product (reproducible/manufacturable design)
  - a potentially profitable product
  - a marketable and profitable product
  - a marketable, profitable product, backed by money and good luck
- Get used to writing your code twice. If you were writing prose, almost any methodology recommends that you revise and edit your first draft, often multiple times. My first pass at an implementation is for me to understand it and solve it. If it’s a throwaway tool, that may be where it stops. If it’s committing to a common repo, I’m probably going to significantly rewrite and enhance the code at least once. If it’s the basis for a new technique/sample code, it’s going to be multiple times with feedback. Seek feedback on your code. Fresh eyes provide fresh perspective. You’ll learn a lot about yourself from others commenting on your code.
- You'll be faced with situations where your colleagues/organization expect you to implement solutions you think are not the best. Understand that "the best way" for the team or business is not necessarily the same as "the best way" for you personally or "the best way" overall. You are likely missing some context about the choice. Be mindful of reputation risks, time costs and maintenance costs involved in changing the approach.
  - When you're asked to code something you don't agree with (including ethical issues) your options include: silently accept their approach, refuse to do their approach, propose an approach (with conversation or code) and gracefully accept the result, or find another job. Be aware that different organizations will react differently to those approaches. Under no circumstances should you fall into the trap of spending a week to convince the team to adopt a change that would save a week of costs.
