- In elementary school I dated a very nice girl who was a Girl Scout. And she was so adorable, with the little pig tails and all. And she says to me, "How would you like to buy some cookies?" And I said "Well, what kind do you have?" She had thin mints, graham crunchy things, raisin oatmeal, and I said "I'll take a graham crunch. How much will that be?" And she looks at me and she says, "...Uh I need about $3.50.‚Äù  Well, it was about that time that I notice that girl scout was about eight stories tall and was a crustacean from the protozoic era. Damn loch ness monster.
- verily I say unto you, no prophet is accepted in his own country but I tell you of a truth, many widows were in israel in the days of elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land
