**Why the titles are not subject names but some weird goals kind of thing?**

I always had issues relating what I am studying to how I am going to use it. A foolish attempt to resolve this is to mention =the why of the syllabus= instead of =the syllabus name(subject)=. Also it's easier to tell the why then to assign a subject because the resources I have under them are somewhat unstructured.

Whenever I have a new information resource, I categorize it at entry. It can go under any one of these:
- This page, =/docs/updates/syllabi=
- The full [[/pages/syllabus][syllabus]]
- Dump file 1 [[/pages/tlr][Technical learning resources]] (need a better name no cap)
- Dump file 2 [[/pages/engineering_blogposts][Engineering blogposts]]
- Dump file 3 [[file:anti_lib.org::*Posts][anti_lib]]

I try my best to not repeat links across these pages. I have not setup any automated link checker for either duplication/backlinks/linkrots etc.

This is my syllabi created in October'22.

  - CRDTs are basically broken: the minute you look at them you sacrifice any guarantees. This paper proposes a principled "fix", but what you need is more than a CRDT.
  - Paper explores a richer API than that of CRDTs, which guarantees both update and query are meaningful
  - CRDTs are a buzzname for lattices storing state. Whats needed is to think latticewise (monotonically) about how you *use* state, not just store it.
