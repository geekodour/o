## Introduction {#introduction}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/agenda_damage.jpg" >}}

what the year is **not** about:

-   not about doing a lot of research.
-   not about making a lot of money

what the year is about(ordered by priority):

-   about making your mind and body healthy
-   about building pipelines for inspiration, planning, execution and money
-   about going back to the fundamentals
-   about fixing human relationships
-   about building things that puts me in the habit of building
-   about putting myself in a position where i can help myself and others if required
-   about taking long term bets

All of this is also based on the fact that accomplishing my goals in "certain
ways" will bring me true joy(i am pretty sure about this one). 2023 should be
the year when the research finally starts happening, where the real money
starts flowing in. In this process there will be a lot of study, practice,
failures, experimentation, careful operation and ruthless prioritization.


## Why? {#why}

April'22, got diagnosed of adhd. writing this in June'22 and still
haven't got my meds. It's that bad. But what I ultimately realized is that my
strongest issues are with:

-   **retention of information**: do not retain shit, recall seems fine
-   **extreme procrastination**: will tell you someday later
-   **extreme dependence on mood for productivity**: dependence on things that i do not have complete control over yet
-   **quickly getting overwhelmed**: terrible management of energy and time

based on my quirks and specifics all of the above can be addressed with proper
note-taking(at-least it'll be a sensible start)

Last year('21), i watched a [lot of videos by Russell Barkley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCldvV9TWPPGM0kRB91G7w/featured) on adhd, which
made me doubt if i am a goat here. Based on recent diagnosis, information i
gathered from the videos and past experimentation/experiences i have decided
that i need to change certain things so that i do not face such difficulty in
doing simple day to day tasks.

This document essentially documents that way of life, some principles, some
rules for myself and how i plan to spend rest the year. In other words, this
document is simply a manual for an year long experiment.

> i am writing this in June'22, but the year still ends for me in Dec'22.


## About existence {#about-existence}

> -   &gt; be me
> -   &gt; good enough kid in school
> -   &gt; 23, realize been living life on absolute autopilot
> -   &gt; two years of realizations passes by
> -   &gt; 25, code monki wagecuck
> -   &gt; quit job for mental health reasons
> -   &gt; decide that need to touch grass
> -   &gt; invent own meaning of life: live for others, catch is i need to fix myself first.
> -   &gt; fixing self is important
> -   &gt; other things will follow

other things:

-   I am no longer going to spend my time and energy revolving around other things.
-   I am focusing on myself, and people i care about. Once that's taken care of we'll move up.
-   I tried my best to carefully craft my environment this time, it’s not perfect but good enough. I have optimized my environment for:
    -   **Happiness:** so that i can get into a good mood as fast as possible.
    -   **Peace of mind:** taking care of my family so they can take care of themselves and it'll not be a constant worry in my head.
-   This time it probably should work, I have been consistently failing at this goal thing since '16. My wins should be spectacular for myself and nobody else.

I found this [awesome table by shreyas on twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223792859469320192), i found it very relatable to how i am trying to fix my life, so i wrote a slightly modified version of it for me:

| conventional wisdom            | real wisdom                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| deal with mental health issues | face it, prevent these issues by understanding the root cause |
| focus on strengths             | also fix your weaknesses                                      |
| always put in best effort      | seek leverage                                                 |
| become president of country    | be strategic, don't chase titles                              |
| make logical decisions         | explore psycho-logical solutions                              |
| market things                  | build a good thing first                                      |

about lifestyle(🐦):

> The preferred lifestyle should dictate your business decisions, not vice versa.
>
> -   Work is something you do that lets you earn minimum necessities
> -   Your business should improve your life
> -   Variable income is a good stressor
> -   Try different things &amp; find out your preferences


## Moats {#moats}

-   **Friends:** Make friends in general. Make friends with people you’d generally not hangout with. Make friends with people all around the world, with people from cities you want to visit. learn how to effortlessly take care and nurture friendships.
-   **Fixes:** Fixes need to be internal rather than external. Not leaving any thought unaddressed.
-   **Balance:** Do not seek work life balance, seek something you would happily sacrifice work life balance for. You won’t need balance that way, you’re the balance mfr.
-   **Execution:** Under promise and over deliver. Create value for myself and for other people.
-   **Uncomfortable with self**: Imposter syndrome is subjective and manifests itself differently for different people, for me it's what @hillelogram mentioned on the bird site. It's stupid but I feel like an imposter because I never was able to transform the cool side project ideas into reality.
-   **To think:**
    -   [ ] Identify my craft, it's definitely not programming. Maybe it's a lot of things.
    -   [ ] Start becoming so good at "something" that you can teach people about it.
    -   [ ] Define my worth
-   **To improve:**
    -   [ ] Analytical abilities
    -   [ ] Creative abilities
    -   [ ] Execution abilities
    -   [ ] Competitive abilities
    -   [ ] Attention to detail


## Goals {#goals}

### Whole Goals {#whole-goals}

These goals are vaguely defined by intent, these does not corelate to doing some task or doing a set of tasks. When these things will be done, i;ll know and then i can check them off. Here I mention of building two frameworks, one for ideation and one for execution.

-   [X] Write the masterplan. Have only one plan, no backups. Roadmap it 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. (starting: 25yo, ending: 40yo). After 40 you should not be worrying about planning things.
-   [X] Build pipelines for inspiration, planning, people and ~~money~~ (money not yet done). More like the eudaimonia machine but for your mind to work on different things. Includes self quantification.
-   [ ] Build a framework where I can test/execute my prototypes in a safe, sandboxed manner. This framework should have good observability. It must have a fast feedback loop.
-   [ ] Practice progressive iteration, create a safe ground so that you can inexpensively re-iterate. be willing to put out a half-baked idea into the world, and use the responses and feedback to continue iterating.
-   [ ] Build a whole social media mafia thing, MLM of pages across social media. need distribution.


### Income Goals {#income-goals}

-   [ ] Introduce money plugs, making money should be a side-effect of what you do
-   [ ] Start passive income, become a passive income mafia
-   [ ] By year end, I should be making 7L a month
-   [ ] Monetize every skill possible, become a whore for next 2-3 years. Study different markets.
-   [ ] Build random things and then sell them. Make [toys](https://www.arvindguptatoys.com/) and sell [toys like this](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CXgkFf0FgOp/). Learn toy product design.
-   [ ] Do lot of Kickstarter kind of projects eg. ergonomic stand for computer table. lightweight and good looking whiteboard, with magnetic box holder in one corner etc.


### Random Stupid Goals {#random-stupid-goals}

Just like a kid.

-   [ ] Place “hooks”, make friends with dogs from different localities, make friends with birds and crows. Matrix shit.
-   [ ] Get driving license
-   [ ] Start some satirical movement like birds aren't real
-   [ ] Learn Dad skills (umm, cooking, how to tie knots etc)
-   [ ] Become a storyteller, make people excited about your story. Create a narrative, break the narrative.
-   [ ] Make eye patch, make pirate cosplay.
-   [ ] Solve crime as a detective. Read books on criminal psychology and how to become a real detective etc. Up your reasoning skills.
-   [ ] Do 100 random little things and pay attention to how you feel - visa
-   [ ] Generate a wild thought pool


## Agenda {#agenda}


### Meta ideas {#meta-ideas}

-   **Right mindset:** instead of saying "i'll solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
-   **Practice:**
    -   Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted.
    -   Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
    -   Do mixed practice instead of block practice. i.e practice after finishing the book vs practicing after finishing the chapter. This way we use much more cognitive power.
-   **Be real**:
    -   Don’t [fool yourself](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm). Don’t blindly believe in your intellectual abilities.
    -   Having a team can bring those projections down.
-   **Pomodoro:** In the sessions where it's pure learning, make sure to use the tomato technique 🍅
-   **No snooze:** if possible, never postpone what's on agenda, never snooze
-   **0 days:** if it's a habit, no zero days
-   **Hard things:**
    -   Do hard things daily so that hard tasks become regular task. break things down.
    -   If something seems too hard, create a simpler version of the problem.
-   **Study:**
    -   Whenever I study anything, if it needs digital note-taking, it'll go in [the wiki](https://mogoz.geekodour.org/)
    -   Whenever I study I should have access to 5 spaces:
        1.  Notes(topic) : The `org-roam` node
        2.  Notes(non-topic): `doom:scratch`
        3.  Questions(topic) : A section in the `org-roam` node
        4.  Questions(non-topic) :  `doom:scratch`
        5.  Feelings/rants/frustrations : `org-journal` / twitter
-   **Build/Apply:**
    -   If learning, build something out of it. A product, a poem, whatever.
    -   At the least, list 2 things that can be built with the new knowledge.
    -   Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. Apply chunking.
-   **Procrastination:** It's a habit that affects many areas of life. Just start, that's the trick.
-   **Complex things:**
    -   Often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.
    -   You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
-   **Sleep:**
    -   Sleep is part of the learning process. Consume new information and let your brain rest on it, so that you can learn on top of it. Don't fuck w it.Incremental learning, otherwise it's like building a wall without letting it dry.
    -   Sleep also affects my mood, so it's extremely important for me to get right amount of sleep.
-   **Context switch**:
    -   Lot of my time **and energy** actually goes into context switching.
    -   Now that'll I'll be doing different things throughout the day, I need something that will ease up the switch. That clears up my mind for the new tasks, that removes any [zombie thoughts](https://www.uwb.edu/business/faculty/sophie-leroy/attention-residue) from the previous task.
    -   Internet suggests batching similar tasks together and performing some ritual if it's a hard switch so that the brain realizes it's time to switch.
    -   My ritual for hard switches: Wash face and legs, sit comfortably, listen to [gravity falls theme song(40s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2DUpDxFJyg), mini stretch, get started.
-   **Habit:**
    -   Habit is an energy saver! no need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.
    -   Once your brain starts expecting a reward only then will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.


### Daily agenda {#daily-agenda}

-   **Building &amp; Learning cycle:**
    -   2 weeks of building then 1 week of learning cycle will keep my mind sane.
-   **Reminders**:
    -   Because the list of capture keeps growing, remind self to consume something everyday.
    -   Remind self to do spaced repetition. when coming back to some info, try recalling it without looking at it, re-read only after you recall. Recall references too.
-   **Meetings:**
    -   Only happens if they are on agenda
    -   Try keeping less meetings either way
    -   Tune people out. demand too much effort? feeling not so good about it? cancel it.
-   **Entry:**
    -   Set both `starting time` and `finishing time` of tasks if possible
    -   Make changes throughout but make commit to notes at time of _night journal entry_ only.
    -   Any day, other than Friday; 💻
        -   Plan next day at the **end of the evening of the working day** (easier to disconnect, be present)
        -   Use `anti_lib.org` to fill _study_ and _consume_ sections in the agenda.
    -   If Friday; 🍺
        -   Plan next week on the **evening**, go into weekend with a clear mind
        -   Sync `syllabus.org` and `anti_lib.org`
        -   Prioritize things in `anti_lib.org`
