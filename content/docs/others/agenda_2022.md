## Introduction {#introduction}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/agenda_damage.jpg" >}}

what the year is **not** about:

-   not about doing a lot of research.
-   not about making a lot of money

what the year is about(ordered by priority):

-   about making your mind and body healthy
-   about building pipelines for inspiration, planning, execution and money
-   about going back to the fundamentals
-   about fixing human relationships
-   about building things that puts me in the habit of building
-   about putting myself in a position where i can help myself and others if required
-   about taking long term bets

All of this is also based on the fact that accomplishing my goals in "certain
ways" will bring me true joy(i am pretty sure about this one). 2023 should be
the year when the research finally starts happening, where the real money
starts flowing in. In this process there will be a lot of study, practice,
failures, experimentation, careful operation and ruthless prioritization.


## Why? {#why}

April'22, got diagnosed of adhd. writing this in June'22 and still
haven't got my meds. It's that bad. But what I ultimately realized is that my
strongest issues are with:

-   **retention of information**: do not retain shit, recall seems fine
-   **extreme procrastination**: will tell you someday later
-   **extreme dependence on mood for productivity**: dependence on things that i do not have complete control over yet
-   **quickly getting overwhelmed**: terrible management of energy and time

based on my [quirks](https://www.adamgrant.info/Being+Human/ADHD/Strategies/Answering+messages+by+first+and+last+day) and specifics all of the above can be addressed with proper
note-taking(at-least it'll be a sensible start)

Last year('21), i watched a [lot of videos by Russell Barkley](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVCldvV9TWPPGM0kRB91G7w/featured) on adhd, which
made me doubt if i am a goat here. Based on recent diagnosis, information i
gathered from the videos and past experimentation/experiences i have decided
that i need to change certain things so that i do not face such difficulty in
doing simple day to day tasks.

> i am writing this in June'22, but the year still ends for me in Dec'22.


## About existence {#about-existence}

> -   &gt; be me
> -   &gt; good enough kid in school
> -   &gt; 23, realize been living life on absolute autopilot
> -   &gt; two years of realizations passes by
> -   &gt; 25, code monki wagecuck
> -   &gt; quit job for mental health reasons
> -   &gt; decide that need to touch grass
> -   &gt; invent own meaning of life: live for others, catch is i need to fix myself first.
> -   &gt; fixing self is important
> -   &gt; other things will follow

other things:

-   I am no longer going to spend my time and energy revolving around other things.
-   I am focusing on myself, and people i care about. Once that's taken care of we'll move up.
-   I tried my best to carefully craft my environment this time, it’s not perfect but good enough. I have optimized my environment for:
    -   **Happiness:** so that i can get into a good mood as fast as possible.
    -   **Peace of mind:** taking care of my family so they can take care of themselves and it'll not be a constant worry in my head.
-   This time it probably should work, I have been consistently failing at this goal thing since '16. My wins should be spectacular for myself and nobody else.

I found this [awesome table by shreyas on twitter](https://twitter.com/shreyas/status/1223792859469320192), i found it very relatable to how i am trying to fix my life, so i wrote a slightly modified version of it for me:

| conventional wisdom            | real wisdom                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| deal with mental health issues | face it, prevent these issues by understanding the root cause |
| focus on strengths             | also fix your weaknesses                                      |
| always put in best effort      | seek leverage                                                 |
| become president of country    | be strategic, don't chase titles                              |
| make logical decisions         | explore psycho-logical solutions                              |
| market things                  | build a good thing first                                      |

about lifestyle(🐦):

> The preferred lifestyle should dictate your business decisions, not vice versa.
>
> -   Work is something you do that lets you earn minimum necessities
> -   Your business should improve your life
> -   Variable income is a good stressor
> -   Try different things &amp; find out your preferences


## Moats {#moats}

-   **Friends:** Make friends in general. Make friends with people you’d generally not hangout with. Make friends with people all around the world, with people from cities you want to visit. learn how to effortlessly take care and nurture friendships.
-   **Fixes:** Fixes need to be internal rather than external. Not leaving any thought unaddressed.
-   **Balance:** Do not seek work life balance, seek something you would happily sacrifice work life balance for. You won’t need balance that way, you’re the balance mfr.
-   **Execution:** Under promise and over deliver. Create value for myself and for other people.
-   **Uncomfortable with self**: Imposter syndrome is subjective and manifests itself differently for different people, for me it's what @hillelogram mentioned on the bird site. It's stupid but I feel like an imposter because I never was able to transform the cool side project ideas into reality.
-   **To think:**
    -   [ ] Identify my craft, it's definitely not programming. Maybe it's a lot of things.
    -   [ ] Start becoming so good at "something" that you can teach people about it.
    -   [ ] Define my worth
-   **To improve:**
    -   [ ] Analytical abilities
    -   [ ] Creative abilities
    -   [ ] Execution abilities
    -   [ ] Competitive abilities
    -   [ ] Attention to detail


## Goals {#goals}

These goals are vaguely defined by intent, these does not corelate to doing some task or doing a set of tasks. When these things will be done, i;ll know and then i can check them off. Here I mention of building two frameworks, one for ideation and one for execution.

-   [X] Write the masterplan. Have only one plan, no backups. Roadmap it 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. (starting: 25yo, ending: 40yo). After 40 you should not be worrying about planning things.
-   [X] Build pipelines for inspiration, planning, people and ~~money~~ (money not yet done). More like the eudaimonia machine but for your mind to work on different things. Includes self quantification.
-   [ ] Build a framework where I can test/execute my prototypes in a safe, sandboxed manner. This framework should have good observability. It must have a fast feedback loop.
-   [ ] Practice progressive iteration, create a safe ground so that you can inexpensively re-iterate. be willing to put out a half-baked idea into the world, and use the responses and feedback to continue iterating.
-   [ ] Build a whole social media mafia thing, MLM of pages across social media. need distribution.


### Income Goals {#income-goals}
