-   For documentation lookup inside emacs, `eldoc` (using `elglot`), `M-x man`, `dev-docs` custom bindings for `eww`.
-   When I quickly need to check the contents of a repo, I use [GitHub1s](https://github1s.com/), pretty neat stuff. I use Replit for quick prototypes etc, pretty neat but need to get back offline as soon as I need to do anything that involves more than 2 files(when writing from scratch).

-   I once tried doing react+vite+storybook with all the right config and other stuff, later I felt that I don't want to be worrying about a static site so much. So static sites or semi-static sites are basically an org-mode export or a next.js site for me now.
-   I think I learned react about 3 times and everytime, the documentation gets overhauled(good thing). But the last time I learned react, I [took notes](https://mogoz.geekodour.org/search/?query=react).
-   Don't ask me about framework preferences. I don't think I agree with myself here.

-   I use Airtable extensively as my data-store for things. I'll probably move to something else if I ever hit limits.
-   Occasionally I'd use Datasette but I want to use more of it. esp the sqlite-utils stuff looks interesting.
-   To explore datasets I use visidata. It [is awesome](https://www.visidata.org/docs/formats/). Not only csv, parquet but also json, sqlite, postgres, shapefiles/mbtiles, pcap files! etc.

-   Netlify or Vercel for semi-static sites
-   Have not got around selfhosting stuff yet, except locally on my pi/laptop when it makes sense.
-   I mostly use github actions for personal projects, I found that the local runner `act` is only useful for basic things like debugging why some environment variable etc is not getting set, playing around with "contexts" etc. Neat tool when learning.

### Mobile Apps {#mobile-apps}

Absolute dump. I use the [List My Apps](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.onyxbits.listmyapps/) app to generate the csv, the csv is then uploaded to dropbox from where airtable pulls it. When generating the org file my custom script fetches from airtable. I did not want this to be a rube goldberg machine but there doesn't seem to be a very clean way out in the way I need it at the moment.
