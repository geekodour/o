> I have this habit of bookmarking different projects/tools/libraries, it has become problematic lately. I can do weekly or monthly review on my bookmarks but if my bookmarks are scattered all over the place, then it's additional work. ****So the best way to tag this is tag at source/entry****

There are similar lists on the internet:

> The ideal state of this list should be empty. But my current bookmark backlog is huge. I bookmark things either because I want to use it directly somewhere or I like some aspect of the project.

> This list is semi-generated as I maintain this tool list on [airtable](https://airtable.com/), which allows me to easily comb through whichever tool I need. It took me 2 days to manually tag and categorize 1000+ tools but it's worth it imo. Now when I make new entries, I directly tag/categorize at entry on airtable. When the script runs it automatically generates this nicely formatted list for public viewing here.
