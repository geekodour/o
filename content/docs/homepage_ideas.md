## Personal notes about homepage {#personal-notes-about-homepage}

-   /meta
    -   backdoors
        -   this is more for my framework of things/products than my homepage.
        -   Have a backdoor for a banner across all your webpages, in case if you want to announce anything you just update it in once place and all your outlets that you have on the internet have that message
    -   main map
        -   map everything i have online(public/private) to one place(hops).
        -   there can be a master image that'll always get updated.
        -   also would love to have a proper diagram of the whole thing. suggest starting the diagram by their own section and as things mature we can work on the master diagram.

        -   [potatoqualitee/eol-dr: A crowd-sourced guide to help techs help](https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr)
        -   Have a public blog and a private blog(not the rant sitE), write extreme takes on the private blog. Have a secret key to it, write where to find it in the public and keep that unpublished. add a watchdog timer to publish the steps to get the key. i.e Once I die it'll automatically publish that.
        -   [wilrnh/emergencywalletcards.com](https://github.com/wilrnh/emergencywalletcards.com)
        -   my manual (see below) should have pointers to when i am gone.
-   /metahuman (please change name)
    -   Make a 3D replica of exact me, a page where this is rendered in webgl
    -   physical properties/abilities/kills/like game character, height, weight etc.
    -   keep track of my daily running, and other activities.

-   /thoughts
    -   a place where i can simply post any thought that comes to my mind without having to think "what will someone think?", i tried very hard to get rid of this insecurity but it's hard. So as long as it stays with me, i really need a way where i can just vent however wrong/bad/thoughtcrimey my thoughts are. If i need to correct myself, i need to put it out. My thoughts are NOT me, i need this separation, due to this fear of judgment i am not able to share my thoughts clearly.
    -   It'll be nice to have hashtags/tags where i post these random daily thoughts. org-journal and org-capture would do a great job on my laptop, but i need some mechanism to do it from my phone. Lot of phones occur to me when i am away from my phone and sometimes i would not want to re-write it from my laptop. See [tg-archive](https://github.com/knadh/tg-archive)
-   /interactions
    -   have a section in your blog where people can ask you about your laptop setup. If i know the answer i'll simply answer it, if don't then you get the answer + some amount of bitcoin!
-   /donations
    -   need to have a donations page, donations to orgs and open source projects
-   /photos
    -   take photo, remind me to take a photo everyday.
-   /food
    -   personal food recipes
        -   [balevine/cocktails: Cocktail Recipes](https://github.com/balevine/cocktails)
    -   personal food preferences and places i like
-   /list of list page
    -   /tools
        -   list tools(across different platforms, maybe separated by platform)
        -   also describe how i make use of it/plan to make use of it.

## Blogging {#blogging}

-   Audience
    -   Since I think writing is the best way i can express myself, i need a way for myself to get heard when i want to, therefore i need an audience.
    -   Write slightly different version of the same blogpost initially to gain some traction. Eg. If you write original "How to install a linux", also write slightly abridged version called "How to install linux when you have windows installed" in a slightly different way and content at a different distribution platform like medium. This will not be required once you have significant traffic on your blog.
    -   If you write regularly and write top quality content then you might as well become premium members in other blogging platforms
-   Document and record the entire process of writing a blogpost from idea curation, generation, research and editing.
-   Blog should have support for usual log articles and also custom designed page for special articles. See this [homepage for the idea](https://www.tiger.exposed/project/lore)
-   Blog should have first class support for indieweb things
