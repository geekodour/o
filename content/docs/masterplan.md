> 🍜💰 Contents of this page sort of describes how I plan to [use my life](https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2020-09-20-On-the-use-of-a-life.html). It's both personal and public. Personal because it lists all my desires which I really want to make happen. Public because it also lists in ways I relate to this world and the ways I want to contribute to it.
>
> I have spun myself 25 times around the sun at the time of this writing and tbqh, I am the dumbest mf I know and I do not have a [lot of time](https://dkb.show/post/life-is-not-short). I cannot be the baddest-X on the planet, cannot work/research on something that will revolutionize some domain, the trade-offs will not be worth it for me. I've been lost in life before and I do not want to be lost again. This document is sort of like the reference I plan to keep coming back to, to iterate, to extend, to modify.

> Motivations behind:
>
> -   Outsource planning and thinking of goal/purpose/direction to my past self.
> -   Planning is important, prioritization is importanter, I cannot get shit done otherwise. We plan because we have shit we want to do with our lives. So plan.
> -   Humans do not think strategically by default, more so for long term goals and on top of that I have `0IQ` and `0EQ`. So this document is sort of necessary for me to be even functional.

## Master Plan {#master-plan}

Our ancestors and fellow humans did a lot for us. The infrastructure we have today is nothing less than magic to me. But there's always something to do, something important to work on. Some of these blue-sky goals are overly ambitions but these give growth to secondary goals which are less ambitions and if I happen to solve for the secondary goals, I ultimately end up solving for the main goal. Not true for all.

<div class="book-hint info">

> My ultimate goal is to leave this planet better than I found at my capacity and live a life I am proud of. For that as mere mortal, I'll have to play my part. Since I cannot encompass the whole of things, I have spent time thinking about:
>
> -   What are the areas I can make the most impact in?
> -   What are the areas that I really want to contribute to?
>
> The intersection of these two is what comprises this section. Most of these ideas are humanitarian. I do not understand all the critical analysis people do. If someone is able to create happiness and satisfaction for themselves in a sustainable way so that all the entities around are also happy. That's the life I want to live. I apply this to myself and want to scale it.

Building blocks:

-   **Quality of life** : Improve quality of life by improving it at individual and community levels. Changes probably need to be at social fabric level by raising the lowest common denominator directly.
-   **Curiosity, Freedom and Creativity** : Allow people to take creative risks. Freedom and curiosity is precursor to doing great work. Most people don't know what price they paid for freedom. Pay the price for who can't pay.
-   **Beautiful imagination that works** : Beautiful imagination is important, beautiful things happen when people contribute beautifully at their individual levels.
-   **Proper resource allocation** : Allocate the right resource to the right thing at the right time. Do we allocate things to problem spaces or solution spaces. I think most problems we face today is because we fucked this up.
-   **Common knowledge** : Make common [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_universal) actually common. We have this wealth of human knowledge and history that we're not able to pass down to the next generation effectively. Education should automate this. Education will not solve everything but I'll be damned if I do not try.

I've divided these goals into buckets of 5, 10 and 15 years. What's mentioned below is just the outline. In other words, they are just [ifs, buts and maybes and not absolutes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_O5YHX4urE) I am constantly dreaming, thinking, experimenting and learning more about these spaces. We'll figure out the actual implementation in due course of time. This plan itself should be in a better shape(more precise, proper estimations) in a year. What matters is only often clear in hindsight, so do lot of shit.


### 5 Years {#5-years}

-   [ ] **Helping** : Be in a position where I can help myself and others easily
-   [ ] **Brain** : Brain capabilities maxxing (calculation, memory etc). I am dumb, i just want to be a smarter dumb.
-   [ ] Hyperlocal movement
-   [ ] **Library** :
    -   [ ] A physical library in Guwahati. Lack of good libraries here.
    -   [ ] It should be open 24x7
    -   [ ] Start a night school in it
    -   [ ] More focus on adult education
    -   [ ] More than just books. All kinds of artifacts about speculative futures. Maps, events, film screenings, public lectures, sponsorships. A home and anchor for promoting discussion of the futures we want, and how we might achieve them.
-   [ ] Schools:
    -   [ ] Contribution to Wikipedia or to broader human knowledge rather than stupid projects
    -   [ ] More focus on communication. After growing up, area that I neglected the most in school happened to be the most important. Think of a world people can communicate better. Build tools around this.
    -   [ ] Microgrants and Scholarships
    -   [ ] Book press
-   [ ] **Capital** : Generate enough capital so that I can go on for the next 10 years without having to look out for a fund to support myself.
-   [ ] **Education** :
    -   [ ] There was a golden age of science but every year we also have amazing people doing amazing things. Have a list of awards eg. fields medals etc and have a simplictic editorial which explains it to a layman.
    -   [ ] By default archival. Making archival mainstream than ever.
    -   [ ] More people doing experiments
    -   [ ] Research be less dependent on institutions
    -   [ ] Define the problem of education (indian education system)
    -   [ ] Monitor the state of the education system and see what is making things worse, what is making things better etc. Build systems and frameworks.
    -   [ ] Lobby the government to change the systems to improve the lives of students and teachers in true sense.
    -   [ ] Build an evergreen system that catalogues everything education, with proper taxonomy.
-   [ ] Archival and data hoarding:
    -   [ ] Political posters
    -   [ ] Music
-   [ ] **Climate change** :
    -   [ ] Proactive work on areas
    -   [ ] Since I most probably won't be able to directly work on the issues. Work on ways how I can channel funds etc.
    -   [ ] A book/website that contains simple guidelines on how to design buildings that are climatically appropriate for different parts
    -   [ ] Help in conducting surveys, help in linking edge research to places that need that research now


### 10 Years {#10-years}

-   [ ] Urban planning, community design
    -   [ ] Have proper analysis around, is it even wise to move to a city with all the conditions it has
    -   [ ] Heavily write about architecture of Guwahati buildings and why it sucks so much
-   [ ] **Library** :
    -   [ ] if we are able to successfully run one in the ways we want, can we run more?
-   [ ] **Education** :
    -   [ ] Start a education research lab
    -   [ ] build a whole alternative education system
    -   [ ] Being a nerd should be cooler than being a movie star or youtuber for the average Indian kid


### 15 Years {#15-years}

-   [ ] Make the world into a desired alternative state.  Don't like how it is; are you driven to make it into something better?
-   [ ] Build a system around which problems faced by humans can be examined and fixed now irrespective of the political/cultural system they are surrounded by.
-   [ ] Fuck the narrative of you can't help everyone. there are people who don't need help that's fine, but if there are people who need help it's our collective responsibility as humans to put them in the right path and provide a kickstart
-   [ ] Since people don't directly seek mental health help, there should be more organizations which can get involved with organized and non-organized bodies and help talk to people about their issues and not just deliver workshops etc.
-   [ ] Kids are taught nice skills like drawing etc when growing up but they are never taught to make use of it or market it (debatable). All the potential hard work they did when they were teenagers just vanish as they grow up. There should be something with which fruit of that hardwork can be used by their adult versions
-   [ ] fast science : <https://kk.org/thetechnium/what-everyone-knows/>
-   [ ] people should feel comfortable where they are, know how to create happiness for themselves, they should know how to satisfy their needs. identify their needs. basically living life is a solved problem, why ppl be facing so much issue then.
-   [ ] know what 'students' in the traditional education system are thinking about their future -&gt; exact data points
    -   [ ] human allocation is super important
    -   [ ] education should teach all kinds of war tactics etc. but at the same time it must be taught that the collective responsibility is that carry the human race forward
-   from bret
    -   revolutionize how ppl learn, understand and create
    -   give scientists the tools to diagnose and cure world's ills
    -   give artists the tools to create and share beauty in ways currently impossible
    -   reform our infrantilzed society
    -   give people tools to resist and destroy consumer culture
    -   give people tools to resist and destroy the corporation's oligarchical control over employment, enternatinment and creativity
    -   return power, dignity and responsibility to the individual

about humans(🐦):

> Till the time we don't create strong communities, we will always feel alone. It is just mind tricking us in believing that 'I' is the most powerful entity in our best/worst moments. To create strong communities, we must accept that humans comes in different shades/color/psyche


## Operation plan {#operation-plan}

This is about how I plan to execute all of this.

I spent time understanding how my brain works and how can i make it do what i want.
I plan to work on both the personal goals and public goals using two frameworks.

two frameworks

-   one to implement things at scale (technical), infra, tools
-   one to organize information and help me think (pipelines of different things, automatically organizing)

## How to approach mentioned goals {#how-to-approach-mentioned-goals}

Since the mentioned [master plan](#master-plan) is just a rough outline. When working on something or picking anything up, I need to at-least answer these questions in truthfully.

-   What exactly do I want to achieve?
-   How can I measure success?
-   Am I actively seeking out information about this?
-   Can I break this down into more manageable parts?
-   Is this really my goal? Or is it just some projection, am I constrained by fears or uncertainties?
-   What's awesome/dope about this?
-   What would this look like if it was perfect?
-   What is that you want to add/change here?
-   What are some questions I return to related to this area?
