## What are you doing? {#what-are-you-doing}

I am (still!) in Guwahati, will be traveling to see a friend next month. I have been studying for last 6 months and this week I'll be starting my job hunt. This is going to be tough, but let's roll. I am hoping to land a job by august'23. Also recently [joined sochara](https://wiki.sochara.org/en/digital-humanities-at-sochara) for helping with their digital humanities efforts.


## What are you studying? {#what-are-you-studying}

-   Studying things in bulk is almost gone, from now on everything should mostly be incremental study and learning things from experiments and experiences of trying to make things happen
-   I made a study topics to projects to work on mapping that I really like.
-   Guitar: This is going very slow, but I plan to make time.


## What are you thinking about these days? {#what-are-you-thinking-about-these-days}

I am slightly anxious these days, would not like to state why, mostly because I am unsure.


## What did I do this time? {#what-did-i-do-this-time}

I realized few things

-   I am slow af, i need to speed things up (I am slow as a person, slowness has become a habit over 20 years, I want to change it)
-   I isolated myself from social media last few months, this month I joined again, some part of me is saying I should not have joined back but it's fine. nbd.
