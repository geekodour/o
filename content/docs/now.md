## What are you doing? {#what-are-you-doing}

I am in Guwahati, Assam and working on 3 projects([betterkeep](https://betterkeep.co), a list of list idea and an offline calendar idea) along with helping my friends with ([@ahdultcomic](https://www.instagram.com/ahdultcomic/)). I am pretty much occupied with chores and running after my dog rest of the time. Summers is finally setting and the weather in Guwahati is going in the direction of better. I saved 30k by not buying an AC this year though.


## What are you studying? {#what-are-you-studying}

I am improving on the guitar. Fingers are better, learnt C-major yesterday. I had to get back to the web-development wagon for some of the projects I was working on. Got pretty good with front-end stuff in last month. Following month, I am planning to dive more into web engineering technologies and designs that make web applications more robust and secure. On top of that I am starting with some lectures that I missed following previously on distributed systems and math. Also planning to get back into infra, observability and backend stuff. Overall, next couple of months should be mega learning.

Also learning a lot about business building, startups and marketing on the side.


## What are you thinking about these days? {#what-are-you-thinking-about-these-days}

Mostly thinking about the projects I am working on. Something that is a worry in my head is my income flow, I need to do something about it, I do not want to do a full time job because I really value the freedom and peace of mind that I am getting doing what I am doing now. I've listed things in the [Gandhi â‚¹]({{< relref "gandhi" >}}) page but it's going to take few more months for it to start in full-swing. So I might pick one or two freelance gigs along the way.


## What did I do this time? {#what-did-i-do-this-time}

I deactivated instagram and all dating profiles, self sabotaged of all the possible future relationships. Don't ask me about it. I'll take my time.
