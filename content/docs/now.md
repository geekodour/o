## What are you doing? {#what-are-you-doing}

I am in Guwahati, Assam and currently working on building a couple of personal frameworks and working on my homepage. Not really spending a lot of time with friends and family. Plan to get started on couple of personal projects pretty soon. It's the summers and sometimes it gets difficult to work during daytime because of it, I am thinking of getting an air conditioner.


## What are you studying? {#what-are-you-studying}

Not studying anything at the moment except the basics of music theory because I started learning the guitar.


## What are you thinking about these days? {#what-are-you-thinking-about-these-days}

I catch myself doubting my ideas and goals as I am re-writing them when creating my framework and goals. I start questioning things like, would working in academia or a research lab is where I want to be, but I quickly shrug it off because clearly it's my mind playing with me.
