## What are you doing? {#what-are-you-doing}

I am (still) in Guwahati. I am taking a break from doing personal projects. I'll be focusing fully on study and getting my fundamentals strong now. I'll do this via project approach though. There are certain things I plan to do daily.


## What are you studying? {#what-are-you-studying}

Planning to learn and re-learn:

-   Languages: go, rust, python, javascript/ts, c++ elixir. Past few months, picked python and js/ts stuff. Pretty functional at it now.
-   Domains: creative programming, solving programming puzzles, building things all at once, Dist sys, DBs, Observability, quite a few things missing from this list.
-   Infra: self host personal services and other services.
-   Pure study: Math, Math, Math, Algo&amp;DS etc.
-   Guitar: This is going very slow, but I plan to make time.


## What are you thinking about these days? {#what-are-you-thinking-about-these-days}

Nothing, not getting to much time to think honestly, just doing what needs to be done. Ass is on fire.


## What did I do this time? {#what-did-i-do-this-time}

I told my friends that I'll be in their city next month when I really don't have a plan. Why do I always pull the axe on me.
