But I ultimately end up saying something like [_matlab aisa bilkul immediate nahi soche hai but sochenge_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4GaJS1C8o4). Now that I have a now page, I'll be able to point them to it.

## What are you doing? {#what-are-you-doing}

I am having a headache tonight so I am not going to write this.


## What are you studying? {#what-are-you-studying}

-   Studying things in bulk is almost gone, from now on everything should mostly be incremental study and learning things from experiments and experiences of trying to make things happen
-   I made a study topics to projects to work on mapping that I really like. (I think this has been running for several months now but I am not super happy with the progress but there has been some progress)


## What are you thinking about these days? {#what-are-you-thinking-about-these-days}

-   I am thinking about a name for the space I am going to turn my house into. Pretty excited about it. AlwaysCookin', Petrichor(?)
-   I am also thinking about funding sources for this space as it's a physical space and will be quite busy when operational, there are quite a few sinks here and there.
-   I am also thinking about how do I switch to the things I think I'll really enjoy etc. It's complicated I'll probably write a blogpost on this one of these days.


## What did I do this time? {#what-did-i-do-this-time}

I've learnt my lessons, this time around fortunately I can safely say that I'd not taken any fucked up decision so far.
