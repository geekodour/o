      Where did you go?
        Nowhere in particular; I'm still here, mostly wasting time scrolling on reddit these days, less time or inclination to browse the indie web scene.
    Why did you go?
        ahh, the interesting and complicated question. there's no clean answer to it; offline life has taken over in a different direction, working from home has changed my opportunities for wiki'ing, and there's a personal reason or two.
    What are you doing now?
        Spending too much time thinking about work; eating lots of yogurt-marinated chicken in Aldi curry sauce; watching a movie every Sunday; attempting to understand what the point is, as always.
    Do you still care about the things you wrote about?
        of course! if I could retire right now, there would be so many paths for me to curate though my wiki, projects to complete, thought trails to investigate. I am proud of my wiki and it shall remain an interesting artifact on the internet as long as I remember to pay the domain name bills ðŸ˜…
    Are you still doodling, drawing, writing, taking pictures?
        ehhh, not so much as I used to. As I'm paused online, I'm a bit paused offline too; I've been choosing the path of least resistance. sorry, y'all, no inspiring answer here.
