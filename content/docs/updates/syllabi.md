> I always had issues relating what I am studying to how I am going to use it. A foolish attempt to resolve this is to mention `the why of the syllabus` instead of `the syllabus name(subject)`. Also it's easier to tell the why then to assign a subject because the resources I have under them are somewhat unstructured.

    -   CRDTs are basically broken: the minute you look at them you sacrifice any guarantees. This paper proposes a principled "fix", but what you need is more than a CRDT.
    -   Paper explores a richer API than that of CRDTs, which guarantees both update and query are meaningful
    -   CRDTs are a buzzname for lattices storing state. Whats needed is to think latticewise (monotonically) about how you **use** state, not just store it.
