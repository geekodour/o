> I always had issues relating what I am studying to how I am going to use it. A foolish attempt to resolve this is to mention `the why of the syllabus` instead of `the syllabus name(subject)`. Also it's easier to tell the why then to assign a subject because the resources I have under them are somewhat unstructured.
