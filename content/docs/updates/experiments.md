## What is this page? {#what-is-this-page}

I have a [projects page]({{< relref "projects#how-do-i-go-about-building" >}}), which is meant for things which I actually intended to do(and failed). This page is more about me itching my curiosity and running side-quests that I must run.

I plan to active contribute(code/docs/packaging) to a few oss projects. This section shall be populated then.
