Extending the [lists](https://nintil.com/categories/links/) idea by nintil, I have decided to publish monthly summary of everything I did in that month. This will be useful for me in various ways because I have an extremely fragile memory and this should probably help me re-organize things better in my head also probably easier recall, who knows.

<div class="book-hint info">

> It's just be a work of re-organizing and summarizing. Sources for summarizing are as follows:
>
> -   `org-journal` or travel entries for the month from [diary.geekodour.org](https://diary.geekodour.org)
> -   links that were finished/dropped from [anti-library]({{< relref "anti_lib#posts" >}})
> -   look at all the commits done to [mogoz](https://mogoz.geekodour.org) for the month and summarize learnings

## 2022 {#2022}


### July {#july}

The whole month of July has been a [wack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYt4tKNTP0), I don't want to write about it or what I did this month or what I learned this month, I am doing absolutely fine but the month only sucked. I'll write proper summary from next month.


### August {#august}

This was my birthday month. It was pretty interesting. I started off with a lot of enthusiasm that this is the month that I am going to start doing all the shit I always wanted to do. I had the perfect agenda and everything I followed through the first 2-3 days and things quickly became wobbly.

Two major things got flagged off, finally started proper work on [@ahdultcomic](https://www.instagram.com/ahdultcomic/) and my [first side project](https://betterkeep.co) after a break of more than three years. My best friend left the city so I hardly ever went out and just stayed inside my house the whole month fiddling around different things. Also started working on various other projects. I did some reading and some writing as-well. On the learning side, did a lot of frontend and general systems design stuff and yeah the guitar.

Watched a movie called _Everything Everywhere All at Once_, it was pretty pretty great. Thanks to Anubhav.

Sort of finished one book about end of life planning. It's called _In Case You Get Hit by a Bus_, read this for some reconnaissance on betterkeep, did not finish it as got what I wanted before I finished reading it. Also took some notes.

Read a lot of blogposts throughtout the month, did not keep track, the only ones I have link for:

-   [Tech stack - by Slava Akhmechet - Zero Credibility](https://www.spakhm.com/p/tech-stack)

Published some writings on my blog:

-   [Landing Page notes](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/landing_page_notes/)
-   [Some ideas about building in public(BIP)](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/bip/)
-   [How to Market Research](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/market_research/)
-   [Understanding your offering](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/understanding_offering/)
-   [Product Launch Checklist](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/product_launch_checklist/)
-   [Lord of all things technical checklist](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/cto_checklist/)

Published two templates, that I think will help me spin up projects faster in the future:

-   [PRD Template](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/prd-template/)
-   [Architecture Document Template](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/arch-template/)

Overall rating of the month, 6/10. I had some pretty terrible experiences that I cannot mention publicly which weighs down the month by a lot.
