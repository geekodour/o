Extending the [lists](https://nintil.com/categories/links/) idea by nintil, I have decided to publish monthly summary of everything I did in that month. This will be useful for me in various ways because I have an extremely fragile memory and this should probably help me re-organize things better in my head also probably easier recall, who knows.

<div class="book-hint info">

> It's just be a work of re-organizing and summarizing. Sources for summarizing are as follows:
>
> -   `org-journal` or travel entries for the month from [diary.geekodour.org](https://diary.geekodour.org)
> -   links that were finished/dropped from [anti-library]({{< relref "anti_lib#posts" >}})
> -   look at all the commits done to [mogoz](https://mogoz.geekodour.org) for the month and summarize learnings

## 2022 {#2022}


### July {#july}

The whole month of July has been a [wack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYt4tKNTP0), I don't want to write about it or what I did this month or what I learned this month, I am doing absolutely fine but the month only sucked. I'll write proper summary from next month.


### August {#august}

This was my birthday month. It was pretty interesting. I started off with a lot of enthusiasm that this is the month that I am going to start doing all the shit I always wanted to do. I had the perfect agenda and everything I followed through the first 2-3 days and things quickly became wobbly.

Two major things got flagged off, finally started proper work on [@ahdultcomic](https://www.instagram.com/ahdultcomic/) and my [first side project](https://betterkeep.co) after a break of more than three years. My best friend left the city so I hardly ever went out and just stayed inside my house the whole month fiddling around different things. Also started working on various other projects. I did some reading and some writing as-well. On the learning side, did a lot of frontend and general systems design stuff and yeah the guitar.

Watched a movie called _Everything Everywhere All at Once_, it was pretty pretty great. Thanks to Anubhav.

Sort of finished one book about end of life planning. It's called _In Case You Get Hit by a Bus_, read this for some reconnaissance on betterkeep, did not finish it as got what I wanted before I finished reading it. Also took some notes.

Read a lot of blogposts throughtout the month, did not keep track, the only ones I have link for:

-   [Tech stack - by Slava Akhmechet - Zero Credibility](https://www.spakhm.com/p/tech-stack)

Published some writings on my blog:

-   [Landing Page notes](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/landing_page_notes/)
-   [Some ideas about building in public(BIP)](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/bip/)
-   [How to Market Research](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/market_research/)
-   [Understanding your offering](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/understanding_offering/)
-   [Product Launch Checklist](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/product_launch_checklist/)
-   [Lord of all things technical checklist](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/cto_checklist/)

Published two templates, that I think will help me spin up projects faster in the future:

-   [PRD Template](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/prd-template/)
-   [Architecture Document Template](https://blog.geekodour.org/posts/arch-template/)

Overall rating of the month, 6/10. I had some pretty terrible experiences that I cannot mention publicly which weighs down the month by a lot.


### September {#september}

I am writing the monthly note of September on 17th October. Needless to say, the month was pretty fucking hectic for me. No journal entry, nothing.

-   We did some progress on getting AhdultComic to speed. The bank really caused so much of issues. We formalized many things about it. Now we have a better idea about what it is and what we want to do.
-   Lot of meetings and lot of meetings cancelled and postponed.
-   Bought saparscribe.today did not have any fucking idea what to do with it.
-   Bangalore got hit by floods
-   Cut my own hair by myself for the first time
-   Days and nights were full of anxiety for unknown reasons but I kept telling myself otherwise
-   Lots of discord calls with friends
-   Return of loneliness in life, but said fuck off to it this time
-   Started an AI art page where we plan to release the threesixfive calendars later on instagram and twitter. Also planning of creating a discord server.
-   Not a lot of progress on betterkeep, but we did make a UX architecture.
-   Honestly, lot of time wasted in meeting people for the sake of meeting. Need to reduce meeting people even if I anyway meet less people
-   Spent atleast 5 days on the discord server for threesixfive but did not promote it properly yet. Feel like lot of effort went into the wrong area here but we'll see.

Overall rating of the month, 3/10.


### October {#october}

-   Started looking out for logistics for threesixfive
-   Spending a lot of time on instagram to promote threesixfive, absolutely hating it.
-   My friend came in surprised all of us on his birthday
-   I finally sorted out my primary and secondary toolchest, big W. It was a lot of manual effort which could not be automated otherwise and long due!
