Extending the [lists](https://nintil.com/categories/links/) idea by nintil, I have decided to publish monthly summary of everything I did in that month. This will be useful for me in various ways because I have an extremely fragile memory and this should probably help me re-organize things better in my head also probably easier recall, who knows.

<div class="book-hint info">

> It's just be a work of re-organizing and summarizing. Sources for summarizing are as follows:
>
> -   `org-journal` or travel entries for the month from [diary.geekodour.org](https://diary.geekodour.org)
> -   links that were finished/dropped from [anti-library]({{< relref "anti_lib#posts" >}})
> -   look at all the commits done to [mogoz](https://mogoz.geekodour.org) for the month and summarize learnings

## 2022 {#2022}


### July {#july}

The whole month of July has been a [wack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZYt4tKNTP0), I don't want to write about it or what I did this month or what I learned this month, I am doing absolutely fine but the month only sucked. I'll write proper summary from next month.
