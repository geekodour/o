I get nerdsniped by myself more often that i'd like, but i still want to keep the question in the back of my head. Other times I am just curious about things and to try it out myself even if the solution to the problem is known to the world. I'll dump my [questions](https://gwern.net/question) here.

### Is IFS not Indian Forest Services? (Bash edition) {#is-ifs-not-indian-forest-services--bash-edition}

-   This stuff is pretty basic but I don't think I totally get it plus there is some "shell" specific behavior that's weird.
-   Also `man 1 read` (fish) and `man 1p read` (posix) are different, what about that idk. fish apparently does not document `-r` but still lets me use it.
