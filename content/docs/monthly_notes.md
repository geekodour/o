1 page monthly summary of things about this month.

-   org-journal things that can be public
-   travel/photos
-   links consumed
-   things learned this month (diff for the month)
-   So all of the things required to create the summary will already be there. I'll just be a work of re-organizing all of them into a monthly summary
