Inspired by [Machine Learning Toolbox](https://amitness.com/toolbox/) , the issue is that i come accross a lot of interesting tools, projects and libraries that i can probably make use of later, or just want to explore. And I do not have any proper place to put them. With this i'll have a place.
Maybe i'll move tools list to here idk.
