I've [a huge memory problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DshRUOm-o), i forget everything eventually so to retain information, note-taking is essential. This is a real problem for me, on top of that, years of constant use of social media has affected me in ways that i do not like.

## CCES Loop {#cces-loop}

Let me introduce my very own CCES loop. tbqh, i just put that abbreviation to sound cool, it's absolute shit. It is specific to how i function. On a regular day, this is happening to me in all kinds of ways so i decided to sort of formally define it here. It's a set of actions that can be applied to certain entities.

| Action  | Example entities                                              |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capture | Link, Feeling/Moment, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Task, Question |
| Consume | Link, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question                       |
| Execute | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question, Task                       |
| Share   | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Feeling/Moment                       |

This by definition does not have a start and or end and can occur while reading some section in a book or while taking a shower. One is free to use any technique/tool to do the action on any of the entities.


### Capture {#capture}

Because we want to make unified operations, we will avoid application level capture. In other words, we want to **avoid** using twitter bookmarks, HN saved, browser bookmarks etc.

-   🖥 : org-capture, org-mode notes, org-roam, buku
-   🏃 : telegram dump channels, camera, screenshots
-   🐉 : multimedia into respective google drive
-   🔔 : prioritize at entry

> note ✏: plan to make a hybrid-image-board which should move my dependency on google drive


### Consume {#consume}

Before consumption it is important to re-organize/re-order information for consumption.

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
> _~ Herbert Simon_

-   📅 : periodically re-view, re-think, re-organize, re-prioritize captures.
-   🐝 : place information where it will be easily accessible while executing. eg. put things into anki.
-   ⚒ : build tools to help re-organize captures.
-   🍲 : actually consume, think, summarize. recurse.


### Execute {#execute}

Execution is the most important part.

-   🍎 : apply what you consumed to something useful
-   👉 : take it the next level/form of it. write that post, ask that question, ship that project.


### Share {#share}

Sharing is caring, share the good energy as much as you can.

-   🎷 : talk to people about what they are doing, learn from them. share your ideas.
-   📜 : share what you feel freely in which ever medium you prefer.
