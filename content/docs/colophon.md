## Why have a homepage? {#why-have-a-homepage}

I have absolute zero game on words but I consider myself an opsimath and autodidact. I have an extremely bad memory and my knowledge about most things is pretty shallow because I never really threw myself into the deep end of things.

But I am changing that, the homepage(and my wiki) are core part of my thinking process. They help me clear random things off my mind and let me focus on what's important, the moment. It really works! The chaos has reduced by significant amount after I started writing out documents for silly things that occupy my mind.

The way I organize, use and consume digital information, I need some place where I can host notes about things that I want to take a look at some later point in time, _organized in specific ways_. A simple homepage was the perfect fit for my needs, a wiki would have been too dynamic. It is also useful to present a cached/discounted version of me.

Also, I know it's stupid but like I cannot be fully me in social media, but here? you can't downvote me! this is my space i'll say whatever i want, one can judge me all they want, but it does not matter to me. I can wriTe like This? don't care. i can also write like this? also don't care. I CAN WRITE LIKE THIS TOO? NOT A CARE IN THE WORLD. i rite liek dis? do not fucking care. I swear a lot? [yes please](https://www.reddit.com/r/effinbirds/).


## Site Structure and Organization {#site-structure-and-organization}

The [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/geekodour/o). It's a couple of org files exported to markdown with awesome `ox-hugo`. The site is then pushed to the forge and netlify picks it up from there. I love my current workflow the most compared to all the other previous blogging workflows.

I canâ€™t claim to have originated many of the ideas [here](https://alexvermeer.com/wp-content/uploads/8760-hours.pdf). It builds off many hours of reading many articles and blogs and other things, which are attributed when possible.


## Things I want to add later {#things-i-want-to-add-later}

Use your nick and not your real name if possible if you don't want your name to appear on this website!

### Quantification Ideas {#quantification-ideas}

I plan to quantify a lot of things. I only want to quanify things I can act upon, so I'll not just quanify anything for the sake of quanitifying. Following is a badly formatted idea dump related to quantification that I would like to explore sometime in the future.
