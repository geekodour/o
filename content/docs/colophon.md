This website be my homepage and this page is sort of like its [colophon](https://hacdias.com/colophon). I've listed why the homepage is the way it is, it's structure and some ideas behind it here. Check [Locus ðŸŒŠ]({{< relref "locus" >}}), if you're looking for an overview of all the personal things I host publicly.


## Why have a homepage? {#why-have-a-homepage}

The way I organize, use and consume digital information, I need some place where I can host notes about things that I want to take look at some later point in time, organized in specific ways. A simple homepage was the perfect fit for my needs, a wiki would have been too dynamic. It is also useful to present a cached/discounted version of me.


## Site Structure and Organization {#site-structure-and-organization}

The [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/geekodour/o). It's a couple of org files exported to markdown with awesome `ox-hugo`. The site is then pushed to the forge and netlify picks it up from there. I love my current workflow the most compared to all the other previous blogging workflows.


## Things I want to add later {#things-i-want-to-add-later}


### General Ideas {#general-ideas}

-   [Guestbook](https://hacdias.com/guestbook) : It's something where you site visitors can leave a feedback.
-   Currently this webpage is served over HTTP, and [feeds(/index.xml)](/index.xml). Want to host it and make it available in more funky platforms like Gopher, [Gemini](https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/04/using-hugo-to-launch-a-gemini-capsule/), IPFS, tor etc.
-   Add a [webring](https://github.com/XXIIVV/webring#join-the-webring) to this page.
-   [IndieWeb support](https://indiewebify.me/)


### Quantification Ideas {#quantification-ideas}

I plan to quantify a lot of things. All of the quantified data that I am okay with being public will be available here in my homepage. Following are some ideas related to quantification that I would like to explore soon.
