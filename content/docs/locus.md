> This page is an overview of all the personal things I host publicly. If you're looking for info about my homepage see [colophon]({{< relref "colophon" >}})
</div>

These things that I host publicly might be an overkill or maybe not the right way of doing things for some but this is going in the right direction for me, if not perfect. I need external systems and processes in place to help me get the most out of my life.
