## Languages {#languages}

My native language is Assamese, and I speak fluent English and Hindi. Additionally, I understand the language of love and money too.


## Policies {#policies}

<div class="book-hint info small-text">

> I want to be easy to work with. I understand you have your own requirements, and you need things to be correct for any due diligence.
</div>


### Control {#control}

While working with you/your organization, I can:

-   Actively sell and market my services in our industry.
-   Fully control all my own hardware, software, etc.
-   Freely reject work which is not defined in the requirement document/timeline.
-   Freely renegotiate our mandate at each renewal if requirements/situations change.
-   Hire staff to do the same(without any change in mandate)


### Contract {#contract}

-   Our business relationship must be founded on mutual goodwill and intent.
-   I provide a service to your company, and I will do so as passionately, carefully, and correctly as possible.
-   If I find myself no longer motivated to work with you, or you are not satisfied with the outcomes of my work, we will terminate the contract under good terms and part ways like reasonable people.

<div class="book-hint info small-text">

> I am happy to sign limited term Non-Disclosure Agreements. I do not accept unlimited term NDAs, I am not interested in taking on liabilities which cannot be practically enforced. Please choose a reasonable NDA term, and I will be very happy to accept it.
</div>


### Payments and Mandate {#payments-and-mandate}

-   I bill on project milestones by invoice.
-   They are expected to be fulfilled within 10 days. Since I have no interest in legal matters, invoices left unpaid after 10 days result in immediate mandate termination, no exceptions.
