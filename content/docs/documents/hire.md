-   Our business relationship must be founded on mutual goodwill and intent.
-   I provide a service to your company, and I will do so as passionately, carefully, and correctly as possible.
-   If I find myself no longer motivated to work with you, or you are not satisfied with the outcomes of my work, we will terminate the contract under good terms and part ways like reasonable people.

<div class="book-hint info small-text">
