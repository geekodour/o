> I've [a huge memory problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DshRUOm-o), i forget everything eventually so to retain information, note-taking is essential. This is a real problem for me, on top of that, years of constant use of social media has affected me in ways that i do not like.

Some random quotes on memory and notetaking that I like:

> -   _So much of what we call creativity and intelligence is just memory. - Unknown_
> -   _Notes aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. – Richard Feynman_


## CCES Loop {#cces-loop}

Let me introduce my very own CCES loop. tbqh, i just put that abbreviation to sound cool, it's absolute shit. It is specific to how i function. On a regular day, this is happening to me in all kinds of ways so i decided to sort of formally define it here. It's a set of actions that can be applied to certain entities. Part of the reason this works for me is probably because I enjoy using it.

| Action  | Example entities                                              |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capture | Link, Feeling/Moment, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Task, Question |
| Consume | Link, Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question                       |
| Execute | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Question, Task                       |
| Share   | Idea/Suggestion/Project, Feeling/Moment                       |

This by definition does not have a start and or end and can occur while reading some section in a book or while taking a shower. One is free to use any technique/tool to do the action on any of the entities.


### Capture {#capture}

Because we want to make unified operations, we will avoid application level capture. In other words, we want to **avoid** using twitter bookmarks, HN saved, browser bookmarks etc. Capture most of the time would be a secondary activity when you're doing something else. We would also want to link new captures to existing notes. When we take notes, we should ask: _“In what context do I want to see this note again?”_ when setting **tags**.

-   🖥 : org-capture, org-mode notes, org-roam.
-   🏃 : telegram dump channels, camera, screenshots
-   🐉 : multimedia into respective google drive
-   🔔 : prioritize at entry

### Consume {#consume}

Before consumption it is important to re-organize/re-order information for consumption. When consuming, it should be the primary activity. We also re-prioritize things at this step because it's the only sane way to decide what to work on.

> What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention, and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.
> _~ Herbert Simon_

-   📅 : periodically re-view, re-think, re-organize, re-prioritize captures.
-   🐝 : place information where it will be easily accessible while executing. eg. put things into anki.
-   ⚒ : build tools to help re-organize captures.
-   🍲 : actually consume, study, think, summarize. recurse.


### Execute {#execute}

Execution is the most important part. Creating content out of your notes is natural spaced repetition.

-   🍎 : apply what you consumed to something useful
-   👉 : take it the next level/form of it. write that post, ask that question, ship that project.


### Share {#share}

Sharing is caring, share the good energy as much as you can.

-   🎷 : talk to people about what they are doing, learn from them. share your ideas.
-   📜 : share what you feel freely in which ever medium you prefer.
