## Meta ideas {#meta-ideas}

-   **Right mindset:** instead of saying "i'll solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
-   **Practice:**
    -   Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted.
    -   Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
    -   Do [mixed practice instead of block practice](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/26/variable-mastery/). eg. practice after finishing the book(mixed) vs practicing after finishing the chapter(block). This way we use much more cognitive power.
        -   Blocked practice (practicing the same skill under the same conditions) leads to more rapid gains in performance but limited transfer when variability is introduced.
        -   Random/Mixed practice (adding variability and interleaving practice types) slows learning but improves retention and transfer.
-   **Be real**:
    -   Don‚Äôt [fool yourself](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm). Don‚Äôt blindly believe in your intellectual abilities.
    -   Having a team can bring those projections down.
-   **Pomodoro:** In the sessions where it's pure learning, make sure to use the tomato technique üçÖ
-   **No snooze:** if possible, never postpone what's on agenda, never snooze
-   **0 days:** if it's a habit, no zero days
-   **Hard things:**
    -   Do hard things daily so that hard tasks become regular task. break things down.
    -   If something seems too hard, create a simpler version of the problem.
-   **Study:**
    See [Taking study notes]({{< relref "notetaking#taking-study-notes" >}})
-   **Build/Apply:**
    -   If learning, build something out of it. A product, a poem, whatever.
    -   At the least, list 2 things that can be built with the new knowledge.
    -   Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. Apply chunking.
-   **Procrastination:** It's a habit that affects many areas of life. Just start, that's the trick.
-   **Complex things:**
    -   Often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you‚Äôre trying to understand.
    -   You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
-   **Sleep:**
    -   Sleep is part of the learning process. Consume new information and let your brain rest on it, so that you can learn on top of it. Don't fuck w it.Incremental learning, otherwise it's like building a wall without letting it dry.
    -   Sleep also affects my mood, so it's extremely important for me to get right amount of sleep.
-   **Context switch**: See [how to context switch]({{< relref "notetaking#context-switching" >}})
-   **Habit:**
    -   Habit is an energy saver! no need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.
    -   Once your brain starts expecting a reward only then will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.


## Daily agenda {#daily-agenda}

-   **Building &amp; Learning cycle:**
    -   `2 weeks of building` then `1 week of learning` cycle will keep my mind sane.
-   **Reminders**:
    -   Because the list of capture keeps growing, remind self to consume something everyday.
    -   Remind self to do spaced repetition. when coming back to some info, try recalling it without looking at it, re-read only after you recall. Recall references too.
-   **Meetings:**
    -   Only happens if they are on agenda
    -   Try keeping less meetings either way
    -   Tune people out. demand too much effort? feeling not so good about it? cancel it.
-   **Entry:**
    -   Set both `starting time` and `finishing time` of tasks if possible
    -   Make changes throughout but make commit to notes at time of _night journal entry_ only.
    -   Any day, other than Friday; üíª
        -   Plan next day at the **end of the evening of the working day** (easier to disconnect, be present)
        -   Use `anti_lib.org` and `syllabi.org` to fill _study_ and _consume_ sections in the agenda.
    -   If Friday; üç∫
        -   Plan next week on the **evening**, go into weekend with a clear mind
        -   Sync `syllabus.org`, `syllabi.org` and `anti_lib.org`
        -   Prioritize things in `anti_lib.org`
