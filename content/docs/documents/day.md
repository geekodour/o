This document essentially documents that way of life, some principles, some
rules for myself and how i plan to spend rest the year. In other words, this
document is simply a manual for an year long experiment.


## Meta ideas {#meta-ideas}

-   **Right mindset:** instead of saying "i'll solve this task today", put your best effort for a period of time continuously over the days.
-   **Practice:**
    -   Deliberate practice is what helps the average brain lift into the realm of those naturally gifted.
    -   Practicing certain mental patterns deepens your mind.
    -   Do [mixed practice instead of block practice](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2022/10/26/variable-mastery/). eg. practice after finishing the book(mixed) vs practicing after finishing the chapter(block). This way we use much more cognitive power.
        -   Blocked practice (practicing the same skill under the same conditions) leads to more rapid gains in performance but limited transfer when variability is introduced.
        -   Random/Mixed practice (adding variability and interleaving practice types) slows learning but improves retention and transfer.
-   **Be real**:
    -   Don‚Äôt [fool yourself](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm). Don‚Äôt blindly believe in your intellectual abilities.
    -   Having a team can bring those projections down.
-   **Pomodoro:** In the sessions where it's pure learning, make sure to use the tomato technique üçÖ
-   **No snooze:** if possible, never postpone what's on agenda, never snooze
-   **0 days:** if it's a habit, no zero days
-   **Hard things:**
    -   Do hard things daily so that hard tasks become regular task. break things down.
    -   If something seems too hard, create a simpler version of the problem.
-   **Study:**
    See [Taking study notes]({{< relref "notetaking#taking-study-notes" >}})
-   **Build/Apply:**
    -   If learning, build something out of it. A product, a poem, whatever.
    -   At the least, list 2 things that can be built with the new knowledge.
    -   Chunking is the act of grouping concepts into compact packages of information that are easier for the mind to access. Apply chunking.
-   **Procrastination:** It's a habit that affects many areas of life. Just start, that's the trick.
-   **Complex things:**
    -   Often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you‚Äôre trying to understand.
    -   You learn complex concepts by trying to make sense out of the information you perceive. Not by having someone else telling it to you.
-   **Sleep:**
    -   Sleep is part of the learning process. Consume new information and let your brain rest on it, so that you can learn on top of it. Don't fuck w it.Incremental learning, otherwise it's like building a wall without letting it dry.
    -   Sleep also affects my mood, so it's extremely important for me to get right amount of sleep.
-   **Context switch**: See [how to context switch]({{< relref "notetaking#context-switching" >}})
-   **Habit:**
    -   Habit is an energy saver! no need to focus when performing different habitual tasks.
    -   Once your brain starts expecting a reward only then will the important rewiring takes place that will allow you to create new habits.


## Guidelines {#guidelines}

-   **Building &amp; Learning cycle:**
    -   `2 weeks of building` then `1 week of learning` cycle will keep my mind sane.
-   **Reminders**:
    -   Because the list of capture keeps growing, remind self to consume something everyday.
    -   Remind self to do spaced repetition. when coming back to some info, try recalling it without looking at it, re-read only after you recall. Recall references too.
-   **Meetings:**
    -   Only happens if they are on agenda
    -   Try keeping less meetings either way
    -   Tune people out. demand too much effort? feeling not so good about it? cancel it.
-   **Entry:**
    -   Any day, other than Friday; üíª
        -   Plan next day at the **end of the evening of the working day** (easier to disconnect, be present)
        -   Use `anti_lib.org` and `syllabi.org` to fill _study_ and _consume_ sections in the agenda.
    -   If Friday; üç∫
        -   Plan next week on the **evening**, go into weekend with a clear mind
        -   Sync `syllabus.org`, `syllabi.org` and `anti_lib.org`


## Daily agenda {#daily-agenda}


### Calendar and Schedule {#calendar-and-schedule}

-   Day outline: [Google calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZDg1MmFlZjcxMmRmMGNjN2UyZTYxMTY4MmFkMTI3NjJhNDM1NzUyNjM0ZjhmMzg5ZWRlZWQ2Mzc2ZTljNWZiOEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) | [Org file(l.org)](https://github.com/geekodour/notes/blob/main/org/l.org)
-   We have a ouline of the day, the source for that is always `l.org`. It's not prone to frequent change. I do not plan to change it in atleast 6months. It's on repeat, exported to `ics` and imported to google calendar as `ouline` calendar.
-   New tasks for `org-agenda` will go in `tasks.org` if I have to create one from my laptop. we have the custom `daily agenda` view that I created(which will not contain external google calendar events).
-   Otherwise, I am allowed to create events in my own google calendar and use the calendars together. This gives me best of both worlds.

### Weird things {#weird-things}

Now it might be stupid to have such rituals but I decided to live life a certain way for which I am giving up on certain things, I have accepted that there are some things that i'll never do etc. etc.

-   [Morning Ritual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12eXM621XwEEdSQA3ejXL2hlcUXWJvOhY/view?usp=sharing): Basically puts the day into perspective. I [use this](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.blockbasti.justanotherworkouttimer/).
-   [Night Ritual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ebO12LPOeOSqpyEAr3YzpURri0tVCb4/view?usp=sharing): I had this feeling of not doing enough, not knowing what's going on etc. Now that feeling is normal and infact sometimes the fact but it does not help. Putting some kind of closure to the day helps.
-   Power nap: I usually don't need this, but sometimes it's different(I cannot describe how different) and I need to sleep for a while. Dreams are super weird when this happens but I think sleeping is sort of the way out of that weird feeling that I feel some afternoons.

### Daily management tools {#daily-management-tools}

Because I get zoned out of my life so much, I need help all the time. After a fair amount of experimentation, I've settled on this set of tools just to manage time and energy.

-   **Habits**: Using [loop habit tracker](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.isoron.uhabits/) for tracking things that I consider habits.
-   **Time tracking**: I did not really need a time tracking but at the moment I am actively trying to make progress in [16 different subjects](/docs/updates/syllabi/) and I can't really measure individual progress so easily because some things are related to work, some are purely interest and so on. But keeping track of time will help me see if I am leaving any subject behind, if i am not paying enough attention to some subject(ofc prioritization has its own place). For time tracking, I am using [Track &amp; Graph](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.samco.trackandgraph/).
-   **Distractions and Pomodoro**: The [forestapp](https://www.forestapp.cc/) is great, I bought the pro one and works nicely when it comes to handling phone distractions for me.
-   **Task management**: Any new task pops up, if in emacs it goes to `org-capture` to `tasks.org`. If not, write it in paper/board/phone notes app and later transfer it into `tasks.org`. Once that is done, we plan for the next day each day and we plan for the next week each friday. Then use `tasks.org` to fill appropriate sections of the day in my personal google calendar.
