there is only certain things i can learn in tths l
ofcourse learning will not be so learnier and well defined but i just wanted to lay out an outline for referece if i ever get lost.

I have other interests but i did not put them here because they are leisure time things and i should not feel pressured them at all

There's no priority in here, these are general popular things that i am interested in.
