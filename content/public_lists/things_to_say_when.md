Will be updating this page frequently because I come up with the best thing to say at places when I come back to my room from where I could say that thing. And it's common knowledge that the best arguments to fights come in the shower.
See [CannedTXT](https://cannedtxt.com/) , extract things out of it for personal use.

> -   what do newbies like me typically get wrong about X? why do think that is? what's your favorite thing about X? why? what's the biggest source of drama in the X community right now? are you on either side or do you see both merits? etc etc. 3 hours have gone by
