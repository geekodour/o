-   when attending a party
-   when at a first date/or maybe not a date/ maybe to know someone
    most of these questions i picked up from the internet, i am have an apology here saying sorry for places where i just randomly snapped something off the internet and i forgot to give credits. But i am honestly thankful that you shared.
    -   what are your day dreams about
    -   what does your soul look like
    -   if you could paint, what would be the first thing you'd paint
    -   how do you treat silence
    -   how do you forgive yourself
    -   what's the most important thing for you
    -   how do you love
    -   what are you looking for? are you looking for something
-   when you see someone throwing a trash can infront of you
-   listing things you can say when someone is grefing, having mental issues etc. eg. May her memory be a blessing
