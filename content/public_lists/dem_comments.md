## Reddit {#reddit}

-   I'm a senior [dev](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/gy6bbp/how_to_approach_software_development_like_a/) and have accepted that senior doesn't mean all knowing. It means knowing when it's time to RTFM, how to handle complex problems, debugging weird shit and being able to plan and lead the application development and deployment.
-   But engineering principles always apply: be aware of your transport; fail gracefully; consider resource constraints; worry about encodings and malformed input and most of all, re-use existing components when appropriate.


## HN {#hn}

-   A data structure can be seen as an interface, a logical structure, a physical layout, or an encoding. When you teach them, you have to start from somewhere.
-   Never say "Got it" or "OK" when someone is explaining a problem or solution and you don't follow. It feels awkward to say "Sorry, I'm still not following. Do you mean that when..." five times in the same conversation but it is worth your time and embarrassment to come away with a correctly framed and well understood situation. Otherwise you will figure out what they meant after wasting hours/days/months solving the wrong thing.
-   The economy is so good at generating value that it is somehow possible for large portions of participants to create zero or negative value.
-   Facing the fact that ideas are ten a penny, it makes sense to see what necessary but perhaps still insufficient accessories an idea needs to prosper. In order of increasing value;
    -   an idea
    -   a good idea
    -   a good implementable idea
    -   a good implementable idea whose time has come
    -   an invention (the concrete verification of an idea)
    -   a design ( a workable invention)
    -   a potential product (reproducible/manufacturable design)
    -   a potentially profitable product
    -   a marketable and profitable product
    -   a marketable, profitable product, backed by money and good luck
-   Get used to writing your code twice. If you were writing prose, almost any methodology recommends that you revise and edit your first draft, often multiple times. My first pass at an implementation is for me to understand it and solve it. If it’s a throwaway tool, that may be where it stops. If it’s committing to a common repo, I’m probably going to significantly rewrite and enhance the code at least once. If it’s the basis for a new technique/sample code, it’s going to be multiple times with feedback. Seek feedback on your code. Fresh eyes provide fresh perspective. You’ll learn a lot about yourself from others commenting on your code.
-   You'll be faced with situations where your colleagues/organization expect you to implement solutions you think are not the best. Understand that "the best way" for the team or business is not necessarily the same as "the best way" for you personally or "the best way" overall. You are likely missing some context about the choice. Be mindful of reputation risks, time costs and maintenance costs involved in changing the approach.
    -   When you're asked to code something you don't agree with (including ethical issues) your options include: silently accept their approach, refuse to do their approach, propose an approach (with conversation or code) and gracefully accept the result, or find another job. Be aware that different organizations will react differently to those approaches. Under no circumstances should you fall into the trap of spending a week to convince the team to adopt a change that would save a week of costs.


## Others {#others}

-   [The nature](https://www.justus.pw/posts/2023-03-19-this-time-its-different.html) and exact value of knowledge work have always been dubious. After all, I might get a great idea while strolling to the grocery store. Will that count as hours worked? Paying someone for their time is easier to justify when you see someone pulling a lever. That suggests one of the reasons the subjugators of our internet economy are again asking their people to come back to the office is so that they can satisfactorily measure each worker’s butt-on-seat time.
