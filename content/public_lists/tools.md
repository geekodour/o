Tools are important, here i maintain a list of tools that i can see myself using someday or just keeping an eye on.


## Web Browser {#web-browser}


## Android Phone {#android-phone}


## Command line {#command-line}


## Not in my radar {#not-in-my-radar}

A list of tools that I want to keep an eye on but most probably never going to use it.


## Links to other lists of tools {#links-to-other-lists-of-tools}
