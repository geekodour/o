This list came out of a mental exercise with myself, in which i tried to look inside and list things that sort of shape me. Some of the items might seem out of place, i need to come back to this and re-think what the hell does this bullshit even mean to me.

-   Candor
-   Empathy
-   Humor
-   Stupid Optimism
-   Rigor
-   Friendships
-   Taking ownership
-   Family
-   Learning
-   Education should be free
-   Generate money from giving experiences/pleasure and enhancing productivity/lifestyle but education should not be dealt with money atleast to the students who cannot pay enough
-   Being smart
-   Being kind
-   Decisions are everything
-   Building things
-   Hypocrisy
-   Doing the right thing
-   Be open to change my mind if required
