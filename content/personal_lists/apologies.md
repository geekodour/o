-   I apologize for all the memes I have stolen and also for all the memes I am going to steal in the future.
-   I apologize to all the people I have ghosted, in my defense I have been ghosted 3x so this is reactionary man. ðŸ˜¢
-   I sometimes steal writing snippets and do not give credit. I mean idk. Eg things like I probably stole this very line from somewhere, how am I supposed to give credit to this line. Whole document will be full of footnotes otherwise.
-   I am very werid in person, sometimes I'll speak non-stop, sometimes I'll just sit like a ghost. If I ever creeped you out just by existing, I am sorry about it.
