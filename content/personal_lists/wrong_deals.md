-   1996: I did not ask to be born. I exist without my consent.
-   2007: For some reason, I trusted bharat da at rajdhani internet cafe who told me to give up programming and study networking because programming got no jobs. I would probably be a totally different person today if I didn't listen to him. But I guess, it's cool. I had fun along the way. But yeah, this was definitely a wrong deal.
-   2015: Joining GIMT(my engineering college) was the worst fucking decision of my entire life. I finally ended up dropping out of college in the final year because I had too many backlogs and I could not take the daily bullshit the college was throwing at me. Ask me to bitch about my college if you meet me IRL ever( I need to be 2 beer down ).
