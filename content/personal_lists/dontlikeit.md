-   When someone repeats something that I understood thinking I was not listening. don't like it.
-   When someone just randomly calls me dump their trivial misery. don't like it.
-   When people ghost me. don't like it.
-   I take my time. When someone(unrelated to the work) think I am being lazy when I am taking my time. don't like it.
-   Raw tomato. don't like it.
