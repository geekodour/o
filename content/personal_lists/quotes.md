Thoughts that my came across on the internet, most of them are cliché and cringe, some are paraphrased, some are directly stolen, some are original(lol) probably.


## Education and Research {#education-and-research}

-   As a PhD student, your post reads like a beautiful research paper. Motivation, prior work, contributions, technical details, example use cases, self-references, future work, even a system design chart. You've certainly sold me on the extension, great work!
-   In Theory, Theory and Practice are the same. In Practice they're not.
-   You may not be the smartest person in your field, but you should know the most about it.
-   there is very little that you cannot learn, just things you haven’t learned yet.
-   Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.
-   And we must study through reading, listening, discussing, observing, and thinking. We must not neglect any one of those ways of studying. The trouble with most of us is that we fall down on the latter _thinking_ because it's hard work for people to think. All of the problems of the world could be settled easily if men were only willing to think.  - Thomas J Watson
-   One of the dirtiest tricks the Indian education system plays on students is to make students believe that they are not capable of doing something so as to filter out students ultimately achieving nothing
-   Spending a few days researching the topic always completely changes how I am going to solve it.
-   Every time we do sit down to learn something, we have to make a decision whether to widen our breadth of knowledge, or to dig deeper into something we're already familiar with. Then we have to decide which thing within those two broad categories we're going to tackle.
-   Breakthroughs happen when what is suddenly possible meets what is desperately needed.
-   We discovered that education is not something which the teacher does, but that it is a natural process which develops spontaneously in the human being
-   A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.
-   It was more important to inspire the students so that they wanted to learn, than to actually teach them the material
-   What I cannot create, I do not understand. – Richard Feynman


## Programming {#programming}

-   why would u write code without documenting it, write for humans man. computer toh 1 and 0 bhi samajh lega.
-   ActivityPub isn't the future. Useful things that are built, brought to market, and meet user needs that may happen to use ActivityPub under the hood are the future. Knowing what is useful for whom and how to bring it to market in a sustainable manner for the people it's intended for is a super critical element. One that's often overlooked. Specs are like plumbing pipes. People care about sinks, showers, and stuff like that. The pipe fittings, materials, and sizes enable a lot. But, it's not what the end users tend to care about.
-   Simple things should be simple it's ok if complicated things are complicated.
-   If you try 'cat /boot/vmlinuz &gt; /dev/dsp' (on a properly configured system) you should hear some sound on the speaker. That's the sound of your kernel!
-   I read about bootfs at a book from our libraries university from 2019. I contacted the lector of it and he contacted the authors and it turned out, that they had their information from the internet, including stackoverflow. Unfortunately I had to rethink my trust in books. - some SO post
-   We reject: kings, presidents, and voting. We believe in: rough consensus and running code. -David Clark 1992
-   A little duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction.
-   Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.
-   The more I research, read, talk to folks, and think about programming, the more I’m convinced that there are no rules. There are only guidelines.
-   "Train Basic every day!"—reads a poster (bottom center) in a Russian school (c. 1985–1986).
-   adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
-   "The revolution in views of programming started by Dijkstra's iconoclasm led to a movement known as structured programming, which advocated a systematic, rational approach to program construction. Structured programming is the basis for all that has been done since in programming methodology, including object-oriented programming."
-   The truth is that programming isn't a passion or a talent, it is just a bunch of skills that can be learned. Programming isn't even one thing, though he had been talking about it as if it were; it requires all sorts of skills and coding is just a small part of that. Things like design, communication, writing, and debugging are needed. Also, "we need to have at least one person who understands Unicode", he said to laughter.
-   `grep` is a word derived from the command for regular expression searching in the ****ed**** editor: g/re/p meaning "Global search for Regular Expression and Print matching lines"
-   The most important advice I can share with you, as you're starting out, is that a career is a long road, with many twists and turns along the way. The best way I know of to excel in software is to keep a growth mindset. The more you can learn and improve, the more career options you'll have.
-   No website is as good as a good book. And no good book is as good as a disassembly output.
-   A three-line proof of a subtle theorem is the distillation of years of activity. Reading mathematics involves a return to the thinking that went into the writing
-   Knowledge Debt, Being a programmer is about being in a continuous state of learning. Letting knowledge debt accumulate can slowly bring your career and productivity to a halt. If you have a knowledge debt in an area that is essential to your work, you will find that it takes more time and effort to write new features and much, much more time and effort to fixing bugs. The longer you take in returning the debt, the more “time interest” it will cost you.
-   Matching string sequences is one of the most common problems you’ll face as a programmer.
-   Reminder that it takes just as much effort (time, money, staff, etc.) to build the wrong thing as it does the right thing. Problem discovery is under appreciated as a practice in software engineering, especially when compared to problem solving.
-   The device(mouse) was patented in 1947, but only a prototype using a metal ball rolling on two rubber-coated wheels was ever built, and the device was kept as a military secret.
-   Condition your brain to think in the world of data structures.
-   As soon as an Analytical Engine exists, it will necessarily guide the future course of the science. Whenever any result is sought by its aid, the question will then arise—By what course of calculation can these results be arrived at by the machine in the shortest time?


## Management {#management}

-   Till the time we don’t create strong communities, we will always feel alone. It is just mind tricking us in believing that ‘I’ is the most powerful entity in our best/worst moments. To create strong communities, we must accept that humans comes in different shades/color/psyche
-   anti productivity can be a new productivity, anti-brand can be new form of brand
-   While they were saying among themselves it cannot be done, it was done.
-   This thing we call “money” is just a (slow, lossy &amp; unsecure) database for labor allocation. Investing is meaningless without people, at least until AGI happens, which will obviate need for labor &amp; necessitate UBI. - elon
-   The world might criticize your ideas. Let that feedback sharpen your insights. You need to be devoid of emotions when it comes to seeking knowledge. The moment you judge yourself for your curiosity, for your desire to connect the dots, you will not grow.
-   Find faults to fix, not to blame.
-   Ask to be involved early or ask for clarity, we can only pick one.
-   How Apple makes even Microsoft seem well-behaved and conformant.
-   As soon as you give people a metric they're judged by, they optimize for that metric rather than do quality work.
-   Cashflow is like oxygen, cut it off and firm falls apart.
-   Ørsted was the first modern thinker to explicitly describe and name the ****thought experiment****.
-   absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
-   Euler went blind and said “Now there will be fewer distractions”.


## Science {#science}

-   We thought the Internet was going to be a global library but then it turned out to be a global bookstore instead. Nice coffee tho.
-   The term "galvanometer," in common use by 1836, was derived from the surname of Italian electricity researcher Luigi Galvani, who in 1791 discovered that electric current would make a dead frog's leg jerk.


## Random {#random}

-   hey baby unclench ur jaw blink a few times drink some water
-   Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?
-   Not really facts… more like loosely postulated theories presented with overconfidence.
-   Yggdrasil is an immense mythical tree that plays a central role in Norse cosmology, where it connects the Nine Worlds.


## Life {#life}

-   Lock yourself in a room making 5 beats a day for 3 summers - ye
-   I speak only of myself since I do not wish to convince, I have no right to drag others into my river, I oblige no one to follow me and everybody practices his art in his own way. - Dada Manifesto 1918
-   lack of regret is hell of a drug
-   You will rarely get more than what you're willing to ask for. By not risking a rejection, you reject yourself before anyone else can.
-   We live what? 75-85 years? I don't want to retire at 60 only to go to the hospital for the last 10-15 years of my life, some redditor
-   The most important thing is the ability to survive until you get lucky
-   "If the world were perfect, it wouldn't be." - Yogi Berra
-   Most people forget that the goal isn’t money. The goal is to spend days as you wish.
-   Consistency is the exponent.
-   The odds increase, the harder you try.
-   The greatest enemy of a good plan, is the dream of a perfect plan
-   If you don't ask for anything, don't be surprised when you get nothing
-   There are so many interesting topics I want to learn, but "I don't have time". The sad reality is: we do have time. We just waste so much of it. Sometimes I look at my screen time and see the hours I could've spent productively. But time management is harder than it sounds.
-   "So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You'd better rearrange your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can't rearrange the universe."
-   Everybody wants to win, but the winners are the rare ones who obsessively practice their craft.
-   don't do your best, do whatever it takes.
-   The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.
-   Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send
-   Anyone who either cannot lead the common life or is so self-sufficient as not to need to, and therefore does not partake of society, is either a beast or a god.
-   Do not confuse motion and progress (man riding a toy horse)
-   Attaching your happiness or sadness to someone is the quickest way to lose
-   Manage your time like a CEO of multi billion dollar company. Seriously, don't waste your time. TV shows, movies, songs, endless bakchodi with friends is easy to do but does give you anything in return.
-   Be soft spoken and DO NOT react to anything
-   Don’t compare your day-to-day activities with everybody’s highlight reel
-   What they say is required is not really what is required.
-   The whole world is not looking at you.
-   Keep your word. Do what you say you will do.
-   Be reluctant to assign bad motives to others. Most of us are blundering, not conspiring.
-   Each breakup brings you closer to the person who is right for you.
-   Learn as much as you can, about as many things as you want.
-   Don't manage your time. Invest it.
-   Actions rule your life, words only help.
-   Give more than you take.
-   An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes, which can be made, in a very narrow field.
-   The formula to induce motivation, in my experience, starts with action, which sparks inspiration, which sparks motivation, which leads to action, and the loop continues.


## Creating {#creating}

-   In writing, the fastest way to build credibility is to state the other side’s argument better than they can


## Geo/Political {#geo-political}

-   Never accept a no from someone who doesn't have the power to say yes
-   “India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.” ― Shashi Tharoor
