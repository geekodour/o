I do not know how to be grateful. But I try. This page is to dedicated my thanks to all the people and things I am thankful for. This list is obviously not exhaustive. I think there are tools with which you can generate a thankyou page depending on your dependencies etc. but I rather just keep it personal so yeah, this will be very incomplete but like cannot thank people enough, that's what.

-   I am thankful to whoever in Nepal came up with the recipe of momo. It made living worthwhile for me.
-   I am thankful to my friends for taking all of my shit. I don't know what I would do without them honestly.
