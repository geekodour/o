I've walked the earth and after I die, people will still be able to access this page(hopefully). These are the people(**unordered**) who made the most direct positive impact in my silly little worthless life. This list is surely not exhaustive. I am thankful to everyone except the terrible ones.

I wanted to write about each of them here briefly but it might not be the best thing to do on the internet.
