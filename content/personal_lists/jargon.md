## Jargons {#jargons}

This is a growing list of words that I came across and I thought to myself, I'll probably forget about this but it's nice, better keep a note somewhere. This list is domain agnostic.

-   **Slashdot effect**: Also known as slashdotting, occurs when a popular website links to a smaller website, causing a massive increase in traffic.
-   **HugOps**: It is a way to celebrate the human, empathetic side of building, shipping, and running software.
-   **Watchdog timer** : Used in Mars Exploration Rover (MER) ðŸš€ See also Dead man's switch.
-   **Unsolicited daemon** : A daemon process that sleeping for a long time, legends say it can sometime have 0 RES memory.
-   **opcode** : abbreviated from operation code, it is basically the portion of a machine language instruction that specifies the operation to be performed. Apart from ISAs, bytecode specifications also use opcodes.
-   **exploratory programming** : programming that is not actually solving a problem but primarily aims at finding how things are working, btw the name is self explanatory ;)
-   **tarpits** : a network service that intentionally inserts delays in its protocol, slowing down clients by forcing them to wait.
-   architecture astronauts
-   complexity merchants
-   SBOM: Software Bill of Materials
-   Heisenbug: Software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one attempts to study it.


## Neologisms {#neologisms}

A [collection](https://maggieappleton.com/neologisms) of interesting words that have recently been coined. In my case, this is just to keep up with gen-z folks.

-   **Link** : To connect with friends or people in person and chill.
