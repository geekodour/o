There's not much to say. My name is Carl Svensson, I'm a computer nerd and this
is a place for collecting my creative output and forcing it onto the world. For
the really curious among you, I have compiled a small page of personal
information.

Personal information

By unpopular demand, I present a few facts about myself. My hope is that you, the reader, will feel a deeper sense of connection with me and thus be more likely to promote me as a possible candidate for world presidency, the Nobel Peace Price in the Chemistry of Physics, champion of the cricket team and hall monitor.

Favourite Vanilla Ice Cream Flavours
planifolia, V. tahitensis.

Street Cred
-1,000 (Negative one thousand), as calculated by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

Movies I haven't seen
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Citizen Kane, The Hangover Part III. (This list is incomplete.)
